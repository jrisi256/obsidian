## Install the Hard Drive

* [I used this video as my main guide for installing a new hard drive into my Steam Deck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSvdsic4_dk). I will write up the instructions below as well, but it is probably easiest to just watch the video.
  
* You will need: Philips #0 Screwdriver, Philips #1 Screwdriver, Tweezers, Opening Tool, Replacement SSD hard drive, Replacement SSD hard drive cover.
  
* First, discharge the battery to 25%, and set your Steam Deck into battery storage mode.
  
* Remove your SD card if you have one inserted because it could get damaged.
  
* Remove your back plate. Do not strip the screwhead.
  
* Remove the motherboard cover. Make sure you remember you screw the screws into the correct places because the screws from the back plate screw into the motherboard cover.
  
* Disconnect the battery.
  
* Remove the [[SSD]] and replace it with your own.
  
* Reattach the pieces you removed.
### Reinstall [[SteamOS]]

* You will need a 8GB USB stick and some way to plug your USB stick into the [[Steam Deck]] (USA-A to USB-C adapter or some sort of USB hub).
  
* [Link to downloading SteamOS](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1b71-edf2-eb6d-2bb3). Make sure you unzip the file.
  
* You can use [[Rufus]], but it is [[Windows]] only. [Here is the download link](https://rufus.ie/en/).

* For [[Ubuntu]], I used [[balenaEtcher]]. [Click here to go to their homepage](https://etcher.balena.io/). It is very easy to run.
	* **Note** I could not get the Steam Deck to properly use the flashed image on my USB drive when I used balenaEtcher. I am not sure why.
  
* Once you have flashed the USB drive with the SteamOS image, plug it into your Steam deck. Click on Boot Manager, and then select the external drive. You will have to wait a few minutes, but then you should see your desktop. Click on the icon, "Reimage Steam Deck". You will then have to wait a few minutes again. By the end, you will have installed SteamOS onto your new hard drive.
