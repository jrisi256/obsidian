## Question from CRIM597 - Sentencing

**1) At least three of the readings this week concern the institutional distinctiveness of the US and its criminal justice system. What connections can you draw between this distinctiveness and the causes of U.S. mass incarceration?**

This is partially addressed in Question 2, but [[jacobsVigilantismCurrentRacial2005]] deal with the role place plays in the application of the death penalty, and in particular how a history of lynching in a place seems to propagate forward and inform the use of death penalty in the present. This is part of the legacy of systematic and institutionalized racism in this country, and nowhere else in the world, it seems, does such a racialized system exist at least to the degree it does in the USA and for the length of time that it has persisted. This racist history of the country informed and led to the state of mass incarceration which exists in the country currently.

[[savelsbergKnowledgeDominationCriminal1994]] (and to some extent [[suttonImprisonmentSocialClassification2000]]) point to the degree which policy makers are beholden to their constituents as another distinctive feature of the USA and its criminal justice system. Many district attorneys and judges are elected. This means their practices are much more responsive to public opinion, and Savelsberg claims public opinion is much more volatile and prone to moral panics when compared to the relative stability of bureaucratic decision making. Following this logic, it would appear that perhaps a feedback loop developed where policy makers whipped the public into a frenzy concerning crime for political gain which then caused public opinion to shift making the public become more supportive of punitive policies which then led to future politicians attempting to cater to those opinions.

Savelsberg interestingly, and provocatively, also claims the academic system in the USA is much more competitive and more dependent on obtaining funding and recognition from public agencies, and this partly stems from the academia in the USA being rooted in a tradition of pragmatism or building knowledge with the end goal being some practical or useful application. The connection and competition makes academia more prone to being influenced by political knowledge and political goals and by the transitive property public opinion. The pragmatic tradition has academia responding to the problems being presented in the political and public realm. Thus academia would be responding to the demand for more punitiveness and shift focus to the individual-level factors which cause crime and less attention being paid to the structural factors which cause crime helping lead to, in some way, mass incarceration.

**2) Another theme of this week is the historical embeddedness of current patterns of criminal punishment. What are some historical roots that strongly shape current punishment patterns? To what extent are these amenable to policy reforms of sentencing?**

One historical practice that strongly shapes current punishment patterns is the USA is our history of lynching Black Americans which was embedded in a broader system of oppression the USA had developed to keep Black Americans marginalized and exploited; first through slavery then through Jim Crow and then now some would argue through mass incarceration. The Jacobs, Carmichael, and Kent piece found that areas that had more lynchings in the past had more death sentences in the present.

Another _embedding_ which shapes current patterns of criminal punishment is a country’s culture and degree of institutional imbalance among its social institutions (e.g. economy, family, school, the polity). While these variables might change over time, it seems likely there’s some degree of stability in these characteristics, and that it reflects some core features of a country and its values. [[weissInstitutionalAnomieCrossnational2020]] established that countries with institutional imbalances in favor of the economy and which have national cultures characterized by individuality are associated with higher rates of incarceration. This is potentially due to the unwillingness of these societies to turn to welfare as a means of reducing hardship and instead relying on imprisonment in line with the institutional priorities and national culture.

In one sense, these practices are amenable to policy reforms of sentencing. Capital punishment can be abolished. Similarly policies could be adopted which would lead to more regulation of the economy and more money and investment being put into the social welfare system and ensuring the health of families, educational systems, and the polity.

In regards to the broader history of systemic racism and fear of the other though, [[unneverRacialEthnicIntolerance2010]] demonstrate in Europe (where capital punishment is outlawed) support for capital punishment is greater among those persons who harbor racial prejudice. This association doesn’t exist just for capital punishment either. Racial prejudice is also associated with more punitive attitudes in general. This means simply outlawing capital punishment will not cause these punitive beliefs to disappear. It would seem as if the effects of systemic racism and how it colors the views of individuals and the practices of the society run deeper than policy changes alone could ameliorate. Indeed we see that as the _policy_ of lynching fell out of favor and became generally outlawed new systems and policies took its place (capital punishment).

Similarly, while it’s possible in theory to change the policies in a country to reflect a better balance of institutions, it’s hard to change people’s beliefs which ostensibly gave rise to those policies in the first place. Furthermore, changing a country’s policies will not change the _culture_ of that country and how individualistic or collectivist it is. There is certainly an interplay between culture and policy, but changing the policies alone will not change the culture.

Policy reforms are important. However, how faithfully they’re implemented by bureaucrats and the degree of resistance and adaptation the populace adopts in response to them is just as important, and these actions are harder to predict and anticipate. They’re also harder to change than policy as hard as policy is to change.

### Questions from CRIM501

1. What do we think of this reading in light of the [[garlandPenalityPenalState2013]] and [[campbellTransformationAmericaPenal2013]] emphasis on the nature of the penal state and specific state-level and national-level trends and structures which may or may not have helped fuel the rise in mass incarceration? Do we find these trends complementary or more contradictory? How might this piece inform other analyses more focused on governmental structure and political context? (Joe’s opinion) → For my own two cents, it would seem that broader social forces shape the construction of punishment structures and what Campbell terms the _penal state_. As an example see the construction of police forces which [[mullerNorthwardMigrationRise2012]] outlines in this piece.
    
2. I quickly looked this up before class using data from the Sentencing Project, and it appears as if sentencing disparities are still highest in Northern and Western states vs. Eastern and Southern states. How can we square these findings with Campbell & Schoenfeld (2013) which found that typically Northern/more liberal states were the ones to successfully stave off mass incarceration the longest and moderate its impacts the most? More generally, how do we square these findings with Northern/liberal states as being perceived as more racially egalitarian? 
    
3. This might be a question we deal with all semester, and it might be a bit premature because we haven’t gotten to policing yet. However, there’s ample empirical evidence to suggest that police officers mitigate crime and reduce crime rates. How do we reconcile this finding with the fact that, in at least some instances, the police were instruments of majoritarian control and preservers of racial hierarchy?
