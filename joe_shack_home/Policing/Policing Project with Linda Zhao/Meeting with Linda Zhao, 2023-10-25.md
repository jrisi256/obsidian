We discussed a lot of things, and I came away from the meeting feeling like it was a really good conversation. The notes here are not an in-depth recount of everything discussed. Instead, they are an accounting of the next steps/research ideas we generated.

* Look for sudden changes in an officer's usual shift. How often does an officer change shifts? When do changes in shifts happen? Is it a sign of a reward or a punishment?
	* I wonder if we could link this with the civilian complaint data. Can we detect effects of a punishment? Reward?
	  
* Look into more details about how this data is being officially generated. We talked a lot about where *exactly* is this data coming from from within the CPD hierarchy. Understand what office and the exact data generating process will give us a better qualitative understanding of the strengths/limitations of the data.
  
*  How long does it take for an officer to get a promotion? Is there tokenism in police leadership (very few Black sergeants)?

* How do officer characteristics (like years of experience) differ across beat assignments and police districts?
	* Presumably features of a beat/district make it more less/desirable to work in.
	* It would be interesting and useful to descriptively look at how officer characteristics vary across shifts and across districts. When do the characteristics of individuals differ from the overall trends?

* We had some concerns about how accurate the shift data is. How can we deal with this?
	* Track a number of (or all) officers through the years. How many shifts do they get a week on average? Is it believable?
	* Are they making arrests/stops where they are assigned?
	* Look at whom officers are making arrests/stops with. is it with officers who are working the same beat as them?
	* Related to the above point, but it is important to understand how regular a shift or pattern of shifts is for a police officer.
      
* Further explore the correlation between officer race, experience, and rank.
	* Are there districts that young black officers are drawn to? In what districts (if any) are the numbers different from the overall overages.
	  
* Joe's big picture idea: Understand how an officer's work environment (working group, district culture), individual characteristics, and policing environment (characteristics of the areas they are policing: racial makeup, crime rate, poverty rate) affect their behaviors.
	* Relatedly, I would like to understand, descriptively, trajectories in an officer's career.
	* Can we leverage changes in an officer's environment to better estimate effects?
