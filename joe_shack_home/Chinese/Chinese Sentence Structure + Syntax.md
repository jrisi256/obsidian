Sentences usually follow the formula:
* Subject + Adverb + Verb + Adjective + Object

When expressing time, the following formulas is usually used:
* Subject + Time + Adverb + Verb + Adjective + Object
* Time + Subject + Adverb + Verb + Adjective + Object
* **Ta shí yuè huí měiguó ma?** --> Will she come to the USA in October? --> **Subject + Time + Verb + Object**.

When expressing a location, the following formula is usually used:
* Subject/Time + Locatin + Verb.
* **Ray jīntiān zài jiā ma?** --> Ray is at home today?
* **Ray jīntiān zài jiā gōngzuò ma?** --> Ray is working from home home today?
* Notice --> Subject + Time + Location + Verb.
## Examples

* **Wǒ yě hěn hǎo** --> I am also very good.
	* Notice how the sentence omits the verb "to be". In Chinese, the verb "to be" connects nouns not adjectives.
	  
* **Question**: Nǐmen hǎo ma?
* **Answer**: Wǒmen dōu hěn hǎo.
  
* **Tā yě lái** --> He/she will also come.
	* Subject + Adverb + Verb.
* **Tā bàba hǎo ma**? --> Is his/her father good?
* **Tā bàba māma dōu lái ma**? Will his/her father and mother both/all come?
* **Dàweì bàba māma dōu lái ma?** Will David's mother and father both/all come? Note no use of possession. We will learn this later. See [[Rules for de and possession]].
	* **Subject** --> Dàweì + bàba + māma.
	* **Adverb** --> dōu
	* **Verb** --> lái.
	  
* **Tā dìdi jīntiān hěn lèi ma?** --> Is his/her sister very tired today?
	* **Subject** --> Tā dìdi
	* **Time** --> jīntiān
	* **Adverb** --> hěn
	* **Verb** --> lèi
## Multiple subjects

Let's say you wanted to say, "I am very happy to know you."

* **Wǒ hěn gāoxìng rènshi nǐ**. --> Very easy for English speakers to process.
  
* If you wanted to overly formaly about it, you could say --> **Wǒ hěn gāoxìng wǒ rènshi nǐ.** --> Which translates to something more like, "I am very happy that I know you."
  
* In Chinese, you can omit one of the subjects.
	* **Hěn gāoxìng wǒ rènshi nǐ.**
	  
* You can also switch around the order:
	* **Rènshi nǐ wǒ hěn gāoxìng.**
	* **Wǒ rènshi nǐ hěn gāoxìng.**
