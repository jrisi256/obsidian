## Rules and uses for bù

* **Tā shēntǐ bù tài hǎo**. --> He/she is not in very good health.
* **Wǒ jīntiān bù tài máng** --> I am not too busy today.

* **Mǎlì yè bù tài lèi**. --> Mary is also not very tired today.
* **Tā jīntiān yě bù hěn hǎo**. --> He/she is also not very well today.
	* Notice the order of yě bù hěn. Similar to English, it does not make sense to say, "He/she is not also well"

* It is only used with the verb "to have".
