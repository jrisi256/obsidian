Pinyin are made up of an *initial* + a *final*. Initials and finals can be roughly thought of as being equivalent to consonants and vowels.

Initial + final + tone = syllable.

**Initials** --> b, p, m, f, d, t, n, l, g, k, h. These largely follow English pronunciation.
**Special Initials** --> j, q, x, z, c,s, zh, ch, sh, r. These largely do not follow English pronunciation.
**Finals** --> See flash cards because there are a lot of them.
