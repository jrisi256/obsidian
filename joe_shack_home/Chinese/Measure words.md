Chinese has many measure words which are used to specify the *unit* of an object so to speak. In English, our measure words tend to be generic (e.g., a, an, some).

The structure typically goes like: **Number + measured word + noun**.

The most common measure word is gè.

* **Wǔ gè xuésheng** --> 5 students.
* **Shí gè lǎoshī** --> 10 teachers.
* **Nà gè xuésheng** --> That student.
* **Zhè gè xuésheng** --> This teacher.

## Communicating time

* **Shàng gè yuè/zhōumò/xīngí** --> last month/weekend/week.
* **Zhè gè yuè/zhōumò/xīngí** --> this month/weekend/week.
* **Xià gè yuè/zhōumò/xīngí** --> next month/weekend/week.

## Kǒu

This is the measure word for members of the family.

* **Wǒ jiā yǒu sān kǒu rén.** --> My family (house) has three people.
* **Wǒ yǒu sān gè jiějie.** --> I have three older sisters.
