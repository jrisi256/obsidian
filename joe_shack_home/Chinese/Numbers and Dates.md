## Examples

* 16 = ten + six = **shí liù**
* 25 = two * ten + five = **èr shí wǔ**
* 38 = three * ten + eight = **sān shí bā**
* 47 = four * ten + seven = **sì shí qī**
* 52 = five * ten + two = **wǔ shí èr**
* 69 = six * ten + nine = **liù shí jiǔ**
* 74 = seven * ten + four = **qī shí sì**
* 88 = eight * ten + eight = **bā shí bā**
* 96 = nine * ten + six = **jiǔ shí liù**

Let's get into some higher numbers.

* 100 = **yī bǎi**.
* 101 = **yī bǎi líng yī**.
* 110 = **yī bǎi yī shí**.
* 111 = **yī bǎi yī shí yī**.

* 1,000 = **yī qiān**.
* 1,013 = **yī qiān líng yī shí sān**.
* 1,100 = **yī qiān yī bǎi**.

In the hundreds, you need to indicate if you are using a zero.
* 100 = **一百**
* 105 = **一百零五**
* 115 = **一百一十五**
* 206 = **二百零六**
* 918 = **九百一十八**

Same in the thousands, you need to indicate if you are using a zero. Although you would not use two zeroes, you would only use one.
* 4019 = **四千零一十九**
* 5003 = **五千零三**
* 3002 = **三千零二**
* 2510 = **二千五百一十**
* 6207 = **六千二百零七**

## Communicating length of time or duration

* When stating how long an action lasted, the time duration usually comes after the verb. 
* Verb + 了 + Duration (+ 的 + Object).
* **我们搬了三天的家**. --> We moved for three days.
* **你开了多久的车**? --> How long did you drive?
## Communicating time

* **Jīntiān shí yī hào** --> Today is the 11th.
* **Jīntiān shí yī rì** --> Today is the 11th.

* **Zhāng lǎoshī èr shí hào yě lái ma?** --> Will teacher Zhang also come on the 20th?
* **èr shí hào Zhāng lǎoshī yě lái** --> Teacher Zhang will also come on the 20th.
* Notice how you can switch the subject and the dates.

* **Wáng lǎoshī jīntiān gōngzuò**. --> Teacher Wang will work today.
* **Jīntiān Wáng lǎoshī gōngzuò**. --> Teacher Wang will work today.

**Subject + Time + Verb** or **Time + Subject + Verb**.

* **Jīntiān wǎnshang Daniel qù jiǔbā ma?** --> Will Daniel go to the bar this evening? You could put an optional **de** in between **jīntiān** and **wǎnshang**.
### Communicating hours/minutes

* **Xiànzài jǐ diǎn?** --> What time is it now?
* **Answer**
	* **Xiànzài bā diǎn shí fēn.** --> It is 8:10 now.
	* **Xiànzài bā diǎn bàn.** --> It is 8:30 now. We do not use **fēn** here.
	* **Xiànzài bā diǎn yī kè** --> It is 8:15 now.
	* **Xiànzài bā diǎn sān kè** --> It is 8:45 now.
		* You cannot use **èr kè**.
	* **Xiànzài sì diǎn.** --> It is 4 o'clock now.
	* **Xiànzài sì diǎn líng wǔ fēn.** --> Now, it is 4:05.
	* **Chà shí wǔ fēn shí diǎn**. --> It is fifteen minutes until 10 (9:45).
	  
* **Nǐ jīntiān jǐ diǎn qǐlái?** --> What time did you wake up today?
  
* **Nǐ jīntiān gōngzuò jǐ gè xiǎoshí?** --> How many hours did you work today? [[Asking questions]].
  
* **Nǐ jīntiān gōngzuò duōjiǔ xiǎoshí?** --> How many hours did you work today?
  
* **Zǎoshang bā diǎn** vs. **wǎnshàng bā diǎn** --> 8am vs. 8pm.
## Communicating Dates

* **Jīntian yī hào** --> Today is the first.
* **Jīntiān <font style="color:green">sì yué</font> <font style="color:red">yī hào</font>, míngtiān ne?** --> Today is April 1st. What about tomorrow?
  
* **<font style="color:green">Sì yué</font> <font style="color:red">wǔ hào</font> tā yě lái ma**? --> Will he/she come on April 5th?
	* We could switch the subject/time in this sentence.
	  
* **Jīnnián èr líng èr sì nián**. --> The year is 2024.
	* Notice how you must specify the each digit of the year.
	  
* **Jīntiān <font style="color:yellow">èr líng èr sì nián</font> <font style="color:green">sì yué</font> <font style="color:red">yī hào</font>, míngtiān ne**? --> Today is April 1st, 2024. What about tomorrow?
	* In Chinese, you must always specify the unit of time after each unit.
	  
* **Birthday**
	* **Joe de shēngrì shì jiǔ yuè èr shí èr hào.** --> Joe's birthday is September 22nd.
	  
* **Last week/next week**
	* Unlike yesterday/tomorrow and last year/next year, most date communications are pretty standardized. For example to say last week/next week:
		* **xià xīngqí** --> Next week.
		* **shàng xīngqí** --> Last week.

## Counting off times (cì)

* **Yī cì**, **liǎng cì**, **sān cì**, **sì cì**
	* One time, two times, three times, four times.
	* Strangely enough, only two gets changed to **liǎng**.
* **Wǒ yào sān gè.** --> I want three.
* **Wǒ yào liǎng gè.** --> I want two.

### First, second, third, etc.

* **Dì yī cì, dì èr cì, dì sān cì, dì sì cì**.
* First, second, third, fourth.

## Days of the week

* **xīngqí yī** --> Monday
* **xīngqí èr** --> Tuesday
* ...
* Except for Sunday which is special. See note cards.

## Communicating age

* **Ray jīnnián (shì) shí jiǔ suì**. --> Ray is 19 years old. Notice how we omitted the verb. We can add it back in.
  
* We can also ask people their age. [[Asking questions]].
	* **Nǐ jǐ suì?** --> How old are you? Because **jǐ** is typically only used for small numbers, this is only used when asking small children their age.
	* **你多少岁**? --> How old are you? More generally for everyone. However, this can be perceived as bit rude/direct when asking someone directly. Something like **他多少岁**? is not seen as rude (because you are asking about another person).
	* A more casual way to asking someone's age --> **你多大了**? Literally translate to "You are how much big?

## Money

* **多少钱**？ --> How much money (does this thing cost)?
* **一斤苹果多少钱**？--> One **jīn** (500 grams) of apples costs how much money?
	* **一斤苹果几块钱**？ Sometimes people will include the **kuài**, but you do not have to.
* **18块5毛钱** --> The full way to say the cost of something. 18 **kuài**, 5 **máo**. You do not have to state the full cost of something in this way, though. The following are both also acceptable.
	* 18块5毛前
	* 18块5毛
	* 18快5
* If you want to say the equivalent of 18.52, you would say:
	* 18快5毛2分
* If you want to say, 18.02:
	* 18快零2分

* **一斤是10块钱**. --> 500 grams is 10 kuài.
* **一斤要10块钱**. --> Means the same thing. More literally, it means 500 grams *wants* or *demands* 10 kuài.

* **这种橘子多少钱一斤**? --> 500 grams of this kind of orange is how much money?
	* You could also say it this way, **这种橘子一斤多少钱**?
	* Or this way: **一斤这种橘子多少钱**?
	  
* Now, if you want to say $18.52, you can say:
	* 18美元52美分。
	* 18点52美元.

## Communicating *approximately*

* 多 can be used to express approximate amounts for a variety of numerical objects. There are rules though as to how to use it.
* When the number being expressed is less than 10, 多 should go after the measure word. E.g.,
	* Number + measure word + 多 + noun
	* 三个多星期 --> 3 - 4 weeks.
	* 五年多 --> 5 - 6 years.
	* 六个多月 --> 6 - 7 months.
* When the number being expressed is 10 or larger, 多 should go before the measure word. Additionally, 多/几 are interchangeable in this scenario.
	* Number + 多/几 + measured word + noun.
	* 十多个月 --> 10 - 20 months.
	* 二十多块钱 --> 20 - 30 kuai.
	* 八十多个人 --> 80 - 90 people.
