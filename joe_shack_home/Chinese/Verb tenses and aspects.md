### Using le to communicate past tense

**Nǐ chī le ma?** --> Have you eaten? It is a very common Chinese greeting.
**Wǒ yě chī le** --> I also ate.
**Wǒ huílái le** --> I have returned (I am back).

Le is a complicated grammar particle in Chinese. Le can be used in conjunction with verbs to communicate *aspect* which is different from tense. Verb tense is when an action happened (usually past, present, or future). Le communicates aspect though which indicates whether an action completes in a certain time frame.

You can also use "le" with adjectives to indicate something is too much.

[This article was particularly helpful in this regard.](https://www.thechairmansbao.com/blog/le-adjectives/)

### Using guò to communicate past tense

* If you say: **Nǐ yǒu qùguò yīngguó ma?** --> This translates to "Have you ever been to the UK?" Have you ever experienced the UK?
* Versus if you said: **Nǐ yǒu qù yīngguó ma?** --> This translates more to "Did you go the UK?"
### Using Le with adjectives

* A very simple example from class: **Wǒ tài máng le**. Le is often combined with tài to indicate something to an extreme degree. In this case, the sentence means **I am too busy**. Technically, tài already means **very** but when combined with le, you take it to the highest degree (excess).

### Using le with verbs

* 

## Yíxiàr

Used to indicate an action which is done quickly or casually.

* **Wǒ jièshào yíxiàr wǒ péngyǒu Ray.** --> I introduce quickly my friend Ray.
* **Wǒ kàn (tīng, xiūxi) yíxiàr.** --> Let me have a quick look (listen, rest).
* **Nǐ qǐng kàn yíxiàr.** --> Please have a quick look.

## Yǐqián and Yǐhòu

Respectively, they mean "before" and "after". However, their placement within a sentence can alter their meaning to "used to" or "will". Some examples below:

yǐqián + verb = "I used to do this".
verb + yǐqián = "Before doing this."

* **Wǒ yǐqián zhù zài Shànghǎi.** --> I used to live in Shanghai.
* **Tā yǐqián shì lǎoshī.** --> He used to be a teacher.
* **Chīfàn yǐqián, wǒmen xiān xǐshǒu.** --> Before eating, we first wash hands.

yǐhòu + verb = "I will do this."
verb + yǐhòu = "After doing this."

* **Wǒ yǐhòu xiǎng xué Fǎyǔ.** --> I will learn French or I want to learn French in the future.
* **Wǎncān yǐhòu, wǒ yào qù sànbù.** --> After dinner, I want to go take walk.

If it helps, **jiāngyào** (which means will) is very similar in meaning to **yǐhòu**.
