## bǐ

In Chinese, you can compare things using **bǐ**.

Examples:
* **Nǐ bǐ wǒ hǎo** --> You are better than me.
* **Nǐ bǐ wǒ gāo** --> You are taller than me.
* **Wǒ juédé déguó cài bǐ yīngguó cài hǎo**. --> I think German food is better than British food.

## pángbiān

**pángbiān** means "beside" in English. However, it is used slightly differently than in English.

* 北京大学**旁边**有银行吗？ --> Does Beijing University have a bank beside it? More literally --> "Beijing University's side has a bank?"
* 北京大学**旁边**是中国银行. --> Beijing University is close to the Bank of China. More literally --> "Beijing University's side is the Bank of China".
* 1号楼在哪儿？1号楼在2号楼**旁边**. --> Where is building #1? Building #1 is beside building number 2. --> More literally, "Building #1 is located at building #2's side."

**pángbiān** might be better thought of as a noun. Really we should be saying something like: 北京大学**的旁边**. --> Beijing University's side.
