Chinese is loose on its rules. As such, you do not always need to use an explicit word or word construction to indicate possession. E.g.,

* **Tā gēgē gōngzuò ma**? --> Does his/her brother work?
## Using de to indicate possession

* **<font color = "red">Nǐ de</font> fāyīn hěn hǎo.** --> Your pronunciation is very good.
* **Wǒ xǐhuān <font color = "red">wǒ de</font> nǚ péngyǒu.** --> I like my girlfriend. You also could omit the "de" in the sentence, and it would be fine. As mentioned earlier, it is not a strict rule.
### Examples

* **Fànguǎn de rén** --> People of the restaurant, i.e. workers.
* **Rén de fànguǎn** --> Restaurant for people.
  
* **Wáng lǎoshī shì shénme dàxué de lǎoshī?** --> Teacher Wang is a teacher at what university? More literally, "Teacher Wang is what university's teacher?"
  
* **Matt lǎoshī shì shénme dàxué de lǎoshī?** --> Teacher Matt is a teacher at what university?
	* Could also: **nǎ gè** instead of **shénme**.
	  
* **Zhègè xīngqí shì kāixué de dì yī gè xīngqí.** --> This week is the first week of school starting. More literally, "This week is the start of school's first week."

### Omitting de

In Mandarin, if you were to speak properly 100% of the time, you would be using *de* a lot. As such, there are rules as to when you are allowed to omit *de*.

* **那个足球是谁的 (足球)？** --> Whose soccer ball is this? More literally --> This soccer ball is whose (soccer ball)? Notice how you can omit the last soccer ball.
* **那个椅子是新的(椅子)吗？**--> Is this chair new?
* **那只猫是你的(猫)吗？** --> Is this your cat?
* **桌子(的)上(边)的书是谁的(书)？**--> Whose book is on the table? --> This one is a bit more involved than the other sentences because there are multiple characters are omitting. Translated literally --> Table's top's book is whose?

## Verb/verb phrase + 的 + noun

When you combine a verb with 的 and then a noun, you create a kind of adjective phrase that describes what the noun is doing.

* **那个看电影的（人）是大卫**. --> The person watching the movie is David. Perhaps translated more literally --> The *watching movie person* is David.
* **我喜欢的颜色是粉色**. --> My favorite color is pink. --> My *liked color* is pink.
* **昨天我看的书是中国的书**. --> I read a Chinese book yesterday --> Yesterday my *reading book* (book that I am reading) was a Chinese book.
* **我买的手机是苹果手机** --> I am going to buy an Apple phone. --> My *buying phone* (phone that I will buy) is an Apple phone.
## bié de

* It means *other*. Examples below:
	* **别的东西** --> Other things.
	* **别的人** --> Other people.
	* **别的地方** --> Other places.
	* **你还认识别的中国人吗**? --> Do you also know other Chinese people?
