Chinese is loose on its rules. As such, you do not always need to use an explicit word or word construction to indicate possession. E.g.,

* **Tā gēgē gōngzuò ma**? --> Does his/her brother work?

## Using de to indicate possession

* **<font color = "red">Nǐ de</font> fāyīn hěn hǎo.** --> Your pronunciation is very good.
* **Wǒ xǐhuān <font color = "red">wǒ de</font> nǚ péngyǒu.** --> I like my girlfriend. You also could omit the "de" in the sentence, and it would be fine. As mentioned earlier, it is not a strict rule.

### Examples

* **Fànguǎn de rén** --> People of the restaurant, i.e. workers.
* **Rén de fànguǎn** --> Restaurant for people.
  
* **Wáng lǎoshī shì shénme dàxué de lǎoshī?** --> Teacher Wang is a teacher at what university? More literally, "Teacher Wang is what university's teacher?"
  
* **Matt lǎoshī shì shénme dàxué de lǎoshī?** --> Teacher Matt is a teacher at what university?
	* Could also: **nǎ gè** instead of **shénme**.
	  
* **Zhègè xīngqí shì kāixué de dì yī gè xīngqí.** --> This week is the first week of school starting. More literally, "This week is the start of school's first week."
