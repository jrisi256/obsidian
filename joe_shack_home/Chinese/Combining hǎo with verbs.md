When you combine hǎo with a verb it turns the resulting phrase into an adjective usually meaning easy + verb. Sometimes the phrase can take on its own meaning:

* hǎo + tīng --> easy to listen to (nice sounding).
* hǎo + chī --> easy to eat (delicious).
* hǎo + hē --> easy to drink (yummy drink).
* hǎo + kàn --> easy to look at (good looking).
