There are four (five) tones:

1. ā --> 1st tone. Long and flat.
2. á --> 2nd tone. Goes up.
3. ǎ --> 3rd tone. Goes down then up.
4. à --> 4th tone. Down. Quick and strong.
5. a --> Neutral tone or no tone. Very light and quick.

**3rd tone** + **3rd tone** --> Chinese people do not commonly pronounce 3rd tones back to back. So they typically change the first 3rd tone to a 2nd tone.

**3rd tone** + **1/2/4/0 tone** --> The third tone becomes a *half-third tone*. Quick and only the down part of the third tone.

## Examples

* **Nǐ hǎo ma**? --> How are you?
	* 2nd tone followed by half-3rd tone.
	  
* **Wǒ hěn hǎo**. --> I am very good.
	* 3rd tone, 3rd tone, 3rd tone.
	* 3rd tone --> 2nd tone --> 3rd tone (no consecutive) 3rd tones.
	* Half-3rd tone --> 2nd tone --> 3rd tone.
	  
* **Wǒ yě hěn hǎo** --> I am also very good.
	* 2nd tone --> half-3rd tone --> 2nd tone --> 3rd tone.
	* The formulaic way of thinking about this breaks down when you have a lot of 3rd tones in a row. Also, the rules are not very strict meaning you can use slightly different tones and a native Chinese speaker will likely still understand you.
	  
* An example of how the rules are flexible:
	* **Tāmen yě hěn hǎo** --> They are also good.
	* 1st tone --> neutral tone, half-3rd tone --> 2nd tone --> 3rd tone. They are also **very good**.
	* 1st tone --> neutral tone, 2nd-tone --> 2nd-tone --> 3rd tone. They are **also very** good.

## Rules for bù

* When you use bù before another word that's a 4th tone or neutral tone, you pronounce bù as a 2nd tone.  See also [[Rules for negation]].
