### Ma

If you want to ask someone if they are busy you can ask:
* **Nǐ lèi ma?** 

But you can also ask:
* **Nǐ lèi bù lèi?** --> This also means, "Are you tired?" Literally translates to "Are you tired or not tired?"

Can be used with any adjective.

* **Nǐ zài jiā ma?** --> Are you home?
### Ne

* **Wǒ hěn hǎo, nǐ ne?** --> I am very good, and you?
* **Wǒ jīntiān hěn máng, nǐ ne**? --> Today I am very busy, what about you?

## Jǐ

* **Qù jǐ cì?** --> How many times did you go? **Jǐ** is like "how many".

## Nǎ

* **Nǐ zài nǎ?** --> Where are you? Literally translates to: "You in where?"
	* **Wǒ zài měiguó.** --> I am in the United States.
* **Wǒ zài jiā**. --> I am in home.

## Zěnme

* How?

## Wèi shě me

* Why?

## Shénme

* What?

## Shéi

* Who?
  
* **Shéi shì Mary?** --> Who is Mary?
  
	* **Tā shì Mary.** --> She is Mary.
	* **Nàgè rén shì Mary.** That person is Mary.
	  
* **Tā shì shéi?** --> Who is she?
	* **Tā shì Mary.** She is Mary.
	  
* Notice how wherever **shéi** is, it needs to be in the place we are uncertain about, so to speak. We replace the question word with the answer to the question.
  
* **Tā shì shéi de lǎoshī?** --> Who's teacher is that? More literally, he is who's teacher?
	* **Tā shì Daniel de lǎoshī.** --> He is Daniel's teacher.

## Zěnme yàng + Shénme yàng

* When these questions are combined with **yàng**, it changes their meaning to mean **how about/what about** and **what kind**.
* **Nǐ hē shénme yàng de kāfēi?** --> What kind of coffee are you drinking?
* **Děng yīxià wǒmen qù hē kāfēi, zěnme yàng?** --> How about later we go drink coffee?
	* **Zěnme yàng** always goes at the end of a sentence. It is a little bit like **ne**.
## The placement of the question word

Up until this point, I had been pretty comfortable just placing the question word at the end of the sentence and that was that. This is not quite accurate, though. The question word generally *replaces* the part that is unknown to you. Some examples below:

* **Wèishéme nǐ lái sūgélán chī zhōngguó cài?** --> Why did you come to Scotland to eat Chinese food? Notice how they why comes at the beginning of the sentence (although it could also come at the end).
  
* **Nǐ gēn shéi zài sūgélán chī zhōngguó cài?** --> Who did you eat Chinese food with in Scotland? More literally translated to: "You and who with in Scotland ate Chinese food?"
	* **Wǒ gēn nǚ péngyǒu zài sūgélán chī zhōngguó cài.** --> My girlfriend and I in Scotland ate Chinese food. See how *girlfriend* replaces *who*.
	  
* **Nǐ gēn nǚ péngyǒu zài nǎ chī zhōngguó cài?** --> You with your girlfriend in where ate Chinese food?
	* Again notice that the **nǎ** does not go at the end of the sentence necessarily.
