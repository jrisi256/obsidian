### Ma

If you want to ask someone if they are busy you can ask:
* **Nǐ lèi ma?** 

But you can also ask:
* **Nǐ lèi bù lèi?** --> This also means, "Are you tired?" Literally translates to "Are you tired or not tired?"

Can be used with any adjective.

* **Nǐ zài jiā ma?** --> Are you home?
### Ne

* **Wǒ hěn hǎo, nǐ ne?** --> I am very good, and you?
* **Wǒ jīntiān hěn máng, nǐ ne**? --> Today I am very busy, what about you?

## Jǐ

* **Qù jǐ cì?** --> How many times did you go? **Jǐ** is like "how many".

## Nǎ

* **Nǐ zài nǎ?** --> Where are you? Literally translates to: "You in where?"
	* **Wǒ zài měiguó.** --> I am in the United States.
* **Wǒ zài jiā**. --> I am in home.

## The placement of the question word

Up until this point, I had been pretty comfortable just placing the question word at the end of the sentence and that was that. This is not quite accurate, though. The question word generally *replaces* the part that is unknown to you. Some examples below:

* **Wèishéme nǐ lái sūgélán chī zhōngguó cài?** --> Why did you come to Scotland to eat Chinese food? Notice how they why comes at the beginning of the sentence (although it could also come at the end).
  
* **Nǐ gēn shéi zài sūgélán chī zhōngguó cài?** --> Who did you eat Chinese food with in Scotland? More literally translated to: "You and who with in Scotland ate Chinese food?"
	* **Wǒ gēn nǚ péngyǒu zài sūgélán chī zhōngguó cài.** --> My girlfriend and I in Scotland ate Chinese food. See how *girlfriend* replaces *who*.
	  
* **Nǐ gēn nǚ péngyǒu zài nǎ chī zhōngguó cài?** --> You with your girlfriend in where ate Chinese food?
	* Again notice that the **nǎ** does not go at the end of the sentence necessarily.
