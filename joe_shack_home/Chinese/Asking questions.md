### Ma

If you want to ask someone if they are busy you can ask:
* **Nǐ lèi ma?** 

But you can also ask:
* **Nǐ lèi bù lèi?** --> This also means, "Are you tired?" Literally translates to "Are you tired or not tired?"
* This is a common way of asking questions in Chinese. Basically **verb/adjective + negation + verb/adjective**.

Can be used with any adjective.
* **Nǐ zài jiā ma?** --> Are you home?

Other examples:
* **Rìběn, hǎowán ma?** -> Was Japan fun?
* **Paul lǎoshī shì dàxué de lǎoshī ma?** --> Is teacher Paul a college teacher?
### Ne

* **Wǒ hěn hǎo, nǐ ne?** --> I am very good, and you?
* **Wǒ jīntiān hěn máng, nǐ ne**? --> Today I am very busy, what about you?

## Jǐ + duōshǎo

* **Qù jǐ cì?** --> How many times did you go? **Jǐ** is like "how many".
* **Jǐ yuè?** --> Which month? **Jǐ** is used when asking which month because months are communicated using numbers e.g., **yī yuè** = January. [[Numbers and Dates]].
* Be careful, though. If you want to say "one month" --> you must say **yī gè yuè**.

Another way to ask how many is by using **duōshǎo**. It is usually used when asking for things like money, phone numbers, account numbers, etc. However, it can also be used somewhat interchangeably with **jǐ**. One key difference between them is that **jǐ** usually needs a measure word.

* **duōshǎo rén** = **jǐ gè rén** --> How many people?
* **duōshǎo rén** = **jǐ kuài** --> How much money?

See [[Numbers and Dates]] for **jǐ diǎn**.

More examples:
* **Jǐ gè lǎoshī?** --> How many teachers? You could answer **wǔ lǎoshī**.
* **Jīntiān shì jǐ yuè jǐ hào?** --> Today is what what month/day? You could answer **Jīntiān shì èr yuè èr hào.** --> Notice that you do not need to add a gè.
* **Jīntiān shì xīngqī jǐ?** --> Today is what day? (Meaning Monday, Tuesday, etc.) You could answer **Jīntiān shì xīngqī yī.** --> Notice that you do not need to add a gè.
* **Xīngqī jǐ Daniel qù jiǔbā?** --> What day will Daniel go to the bar?
## duōjiǔ

See [[Numbers and Dates]].
## Nǎ er

* **Nǐ zài nǎ er?** --> Where are you? Literally translates to: "You in where?"
	* **Wǒ zài měiguó.** --> I am in the United States.
* **Wǒ zài jiā**. --> I am in home.

Other examples:
* **Nǐmen qùle Rìběn de nǎ er?** --> Where did you go in Japan?
* **Ray de jiā zài nǎ er?** --> Where is the home of Ray?
* **Tā gēgē zài nǎ er gōngzuò?** --> Where does his older brother work? More literally. His older brothers works at where?
* **Jiàoshì zài nǎ er?** --> Where is the classroom?
	* **Jiàoshì zài dàxué.** --> The classroom is in the university.

You can also use **shénme dìfang** in place of **nǎ er** which literally translates to "what place".

## Zěnme

How? Because of the structure of Chinese sentences and Chinese grammar, *how* gets used slightly differently than English speakers are used to.

* **玛丽怎么学习汉语**？ --> How does Mary study Chinese?
* **玛丽在大学学习汉语**。--> Mary studies Chinese at the university. More literally, "Mary at university studies Chinese".
* **我去北京大学，怎么走？** --> A literal translation, "I go to Beijing University, how do I go?". A more realistic translation would be, "How do I get to Beijing University?"
## Wèi shě me

* Why?
## Shénme

* What?
* **Shàng gè zhōumò nǐ zuòle shénme?** --> What did you do last weekend?. More literally, "Last weekend, you did what?" Also remember [[Chinese Sentence Structure + Syntax]]. Subject/Time + Verb. Could reverse the order of last weekend + the subject.
* **Jīntiān Ray lǎoshī zuò shénme?** --> What did Ray do today?
## Shénme shíhòu

* When?
* **Nǐ de shēngrì shì shénme shíhòu?** --> When is your brithday.
* **Wǒ de shēngrì shì 1993 nián 9 yuè 22 hào.**
## Shéi

* Who?
  
* **Shéi shì Mary?** --> Who is Mary?
	* **Tā shì Mary.** --> She is Mary.
	* **Nàgè rén shì Mary.** That person is Mary.
	  
* **Tā shì shéi?** --> Who is she?
	* **Tā shì Mary.** She is Mary.
	  
* Notice how wherever **shéi** is, it needs to be in the place we are uncertain about, so to speak. We replace the question word with the answer to the question.
  
* **Tā shì shéi de lǎoshī?** --> Who's teacher is that? More literally, he is who's teacher?
	* **Tā shì Daniel de lǎoshī.** --> He is Daniel's teacher.
	  
* **Shéi shì Wáng lǎoshī de xuéshēng?** --> Who is the student of teacher Wang?

## Zěnme yàng + Shénme yàng

* When these questions are combined with **yàng**, it changes their meaning to mean **how about/what about** and **what kind**.
* **Nǐ hē shénme yàng de kāfēi?** --> What kind of coffee are you drinking?
* **Děng yīxià wǒmen qù hē kāfēi, zěnme yàng?** --> How about later we go drink coffee?
	* **Zěnme yàng** always goes at the end of a sentence. It is a little bit like **ne**.
* **今天的天气怎么样**？ --> Literally, "Today's weather, how about?" More correctly, "How is today's weather?"
* **王老师的身体怎么样？** --> How is Wang Laoshi's health?
* **她的英语怎么样？** --> How is her English?
* **他的工作怎么样？** --> How is his work?
## The placement of the question word

Up until this point, I had been pretty comfortable just placing the question word at the end of the sentence and that was that. This is not quite accurate, though. The question word generally *replaces* the part that is unknown to you. Some examples below:

* **Wèishéme nǐ lái sūgélán chī zhōngguó cài?** --> Why did you come to Scotland to eat Chinese food? Notice how they why comes at the beginning of the sentence (although it could also come at the end).
  
* **Nǐ gēn shéi zài sūgélán chī zhōngguó cài?** --> Who did you eat Chinese food with in Scotland? More literally translated to: "You and who with in Scotland ate Chinese food?"
	* **Wǒ gēn nǚ péngyǒu zài sūgélán chī zhōngguó cài.** --> My girlfriend and I in Scotland ate Chinese food. See how *girlfriend* replaces *who*.
	  
* **Nǐ gēn nǚ péngyǒu zài nǎ chī zhōngguó cài?** --> You with your girlfriend in where ate Chinese food?
	* Again notice that the **nǎ** does not go at the end of the sentence necessarily.
