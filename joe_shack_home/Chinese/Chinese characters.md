## Chinese character formation

The **principles of Chinese character formation** refer to the structure and composition methods of Chinese characters, primarily based on the **Six Principles** (六書), which describe six basic methods for creating and using characters. These include:

1. **Pictographs (象形)**: Characters are created by drawing the shape of objects.
    
    - Example:
        - "日" (rì) represents the sun.
        - "月" (yuè) represents the moon.
        - "山" (shān) represents a mountain.
        - "木" (mù) represents a tree.
2. **Ideographs (指事)**: Abstract concepts are represented by simple symbols or marks.
    
    - Example:
        - "上" (shàng) means "above" or "up."
        - "下" (xià) means "below" or "down."
        - "本" (běn) shows the root of a tree (indicating "origin").
3. **Compound Ideographs (會意)**: Characters are formed by combining two or more symbols to convey a new meaning.
    
    - Example:
        - "明" (míng), formed by combining "日" (sun) and "月" (moon), means "bright."
        - "休" (xiū), formed by combining "人" (person) and "木" (tree), means "rest" (a person resting by a tree).
        - "好" (hǎo), combining "女" (woman) and "子" (child), means "good."
4. **Phono-semantic compounds (形聲)**: A character is created by combining a meaning component (semantic) with a sound component (phonetic). The semantic part indicates the meaning, while the phonetic part provides a clue to pronunciation.
    
    - Example:
        - "河" (hé) means "river," with the water radical "氵" representing water, and "可" (kě) indicating the sound.
        - "清" (qīng) means "clear," with "氵" (water) and "青" (qīng) for the sound.
        - "媽" (mā) means "mother," combining "女" (woman) for meaning and "馬" (mǎ) for sound.
5. **Mutual Explanations (轉注)**: Characters are derived from each other and share meanings or reinforce each other's meanings.
    
    - Example:
        - "考" (kǎo) and "老" (lǎo) are related. "考" originally meant "to respect the elderly," and "老" means "old."
6. **Borrowing (假借)**: Existing characters are borrowed to represent unrelated sounds or meanings, often leading to characters taking on additional meanings.
    
    - Example:
        - "自" (zì) originally depicted a nose, but it was borrowed to mean "self."
        - "來" (lái), which originally depicted wheat, now means "come."

These six principles explain the formation of Chinese characters from the perspectives of form, sound, and meaning, and show the creativity and flexibility in character construction.

## Radicals

Chinese **radicals** are the basic components of Chinese characters, used to express meaning or to categorize characters, especially for looking up characters in dictionaries. Radicals often reflect the semantic features of a character and are also known as "character components" or "side components." In the **Kangxi Dictionary**, there are a total of **214 radicals**.
