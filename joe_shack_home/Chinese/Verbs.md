## Combining verbs

* **Wǒ bù xǐhuān hē kāfēi** --> I do not like to drink coffee.
* **Matt de jiějie zài shāngdiàn gōngzuò ma?** --> Matt's older sister works in the shop?

## gōngzuò

* **Gōngzuò** can be a noun and a verb (like in English).
	* **Tāmen gōngzuò yě hěn máng.** --> Their work is also very busy.
* **Jīntiān Wáng lǎoshī bù gōngzuò. Tā xiūxi.** --> Today teacher Wang does not work. He rests.

## Using verbs to indicate the affirmative

* **Shì, wǒ shì dàifu.** --> Yes, I am a doctor.

## tīng

* **Wǒ tīng nǐ de shēngyīn <font color="red">wǒ</font> chīfàn.** --> I can hear your voice while I am eating.
	* Chinese speakers would not typically add in the wǒ.
* **Wǒ tīng dào nǐ chīfàn de shēngyīn.** --> I hear you eating.
	* Not quite sure what **dào** and **dédào** mean yet.

* **Nǐ kàn dédào ma?** --> Can you see (it)?
	* **Dédào** --> By itself, it means to receive something or to obtain something. It does not intuitively translate into English. It might translate into something like, "Did you receive this sight?"
	* It is used in conjunction with one's senses when they are used as a verb: sight, smell, hearing.

## xíguàn

* It can be used as a verb and a noun. When it is used as a verb, it means "used to" in both senses. As in, "I used to go running every morning." and "I am used to spicy food". As a noun, it roughly means something like "habit".
	* **Wǒ xíguàn Dàlián cài.** --> I am used to the food of Dalian.
	* **Wǒ xíguàn chī Dàlián cài.** --> I used to eat the food of Dalian.
	* **Nǐ xíguàn Dàlián de tiānqì?** --> Are you used to the weather of Dalian?
	* **Wǒ de xíguàn shì zǎoshang yībēi kāfēi**. --> My habit is a morning cup of coffee.

## huí and qù

* **Wo huí jiā.** --> I go home. Chinese people do not say **Wǒ qù jiā**.
* You can say: **wǒ qù péngyǒu jiā**.

## qǐng

It can mean please or to invite.
* **Wǒ qǐng Ray lái wǒ jiā.** --> I invite Ray to come to my home.

## yào

**Yào** is an interesting verb because it can to want OR to need. It can also mean "to cost".
* **Yībēi kāfēi yào wǔ kuài qián.** --> A cup of coffee costs five dollars.

## huān yíng

To welcome someone.
* **欢迎**你来我家. --> You are welcome to come to my home. It can also be an invitation in the moment.
* **欢迎**你们来上海 --> They are welcome to come to Shanghai.

## wán

It means to play, but it can also mean "to hang out" or "to have fun".
* 我去朋友家**玩**. --> I go to my friend's house to hang out.
* 今年我去美国**玩**. --> This year I will go to the USA for fun.

## huì

It means "will" as in, "I will do something" or "Will you do something?"
* **Nǐmen huì yǒu yīgè xiǎo pàiduì ma?** --> You guys will have a small party?

## yǒu + verb

It functions very similarly as in English. Translates to "Have you...?" or "I have...". Like in English, it is largely interchangeable with the past tense and thus in Chinese could be replaced with 了。

* Subject + 有 + Verb.
* 我有吃午饭. --> I have eaten lunch.
* 我吃了午饭. --> I ate lunch.
