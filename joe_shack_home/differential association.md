## Introduction to Sutherland

1. What was Sutherland reacting against?
	1. He was reacting against the **multifactor approach**. Describe or list all the concrete conditions associated with crime (race, age, sex, socioeconomic status, etc.).
	2. Unfocused and unparsimonious. It was fact-finding and fact-reporting. Fails to actually explain why someone would commit a crime.
	3. E.g., men are more likely than women to commit a crime. This fact doesn’t tell you why this would be the case nor does it help you understand why the vast majority of men don’t commit crime. 
2. What did he view as the job of theory?
	1. Provide a necessary and sufficient explanation of the phenomenon (identifying those conditions always present when crime is committed and when crime is committed these conditions are always present).
3. How do you create good theory? How do theories do a good job?
	1. **Logical Abstraction** -> Gather all the established facts together and work out the abstract concept which binds them all together/explains them.
	2. **Differential levels of explanation** -> Theory has to remain abstract. It cannot explain everything all at once. Therefore hold certain things constant and establish bounds on what the theory is supposed to explain.
	3. **Analytic Induction**
		1. Define the universe trying to be explained.
		2. Formulate a tentative hypothesis.
		3. If you find a case that doesn’t fit, discard the hypothesis or narrow the universe.
		4. Continue searching for negative cases while confidence builds in your theory for each case it can successfully explain.  

## Sutherland’s theory of differential association (and differential social organization)

![[da_social-learning_model_crim512.jpg]]

1. Criminal behavior is learned through interacting with other people. When criminal behavior is learned, learning involves not only how to be a criminal, but it also involves learning or internalizing pro-criminal messages, attitudes, norms, and orientations.
2. Conforming behavior is learned in the same way as criminal behavior.
3. A person will then deviate when the sum of their associations, learning, and internalizing towards crime is greater than the sum of their associations, learning, and internalizing towards conformity.
4. At the root of criminal behavior is normative conflict. One set of associations and messages are orienting you towards conformity and another set of associations and messages are orienting you towards crime. The one which wins out is the one that exists in excess.
5. Differential social organization is the macro-level instantiation of differential association (which is used to explain individual behaviors). The crime rate of a given area is an expression of the differential between pro-crime and anti-crime groups/organizational patterns and their relative power in influencing members of society. Their power to influence comes from their lower/higher probability of exposing individuals to pro-crime/anti-crime messaging and patterns.  

### Modalities of learning

1. The modalities of learning: What affects learning of criminal/conforming behavior?
	1. **Frequency**: How often are you exposed?
	2. **Duration**: For how long are you exposed when you’re exposed?
	3. **Priority**: When in life did you first become exposed? Earlier exposure, all else equal, will hold more weight.
	4. **Intensity**: What is the source from which you’re learning the behavior? Do you trust and/or admire them? What emotional response do they elicit in you?

* Differential association is not merely peer pressure/peer influence. Family plays a very important rule in teaching you and building up associations with criminal/conforming behavior.
  
- Even beyond that point, differential association does not only refer to persons. We learn from people, yes, but we’re learning patterns of behaviors, associations, messages from these people, which we’re about to get into.
  
- Think about why drug counselors don’t start engaging in deviant drug behavior. They are frequently exposed to drug users often for long durations. However the priority and intensity are quite weak. Additionally, the messages and associations in their life are strongly organized in favor of conformity. Relates to the previous point. Not just about people.

### What is meant, specifically, by associations and messages?

![[steffensmeier_messages_crim512.jpg]]

The above come from class notes and not my original assignment:

* **Stereotyping** -> Assignment of traits/characteristics/images to categories/groups of individuals. Cognitive shortcuts to help us understand the complexity of the world, helps us navigate it. Spinoff of conduct norms. Helps buttress them. Those in authority or maybe conventional society stereotypes those who engage in anti-social behavior. Aims to discourage people from engaging in those behaviors. Messages of conformity. Else we deal with the put-down and stigmas associated with it. With marijuana usage you create new conduct norms, overcome the negative stereotypes, create "positive" stereotypes of the new behavior and its effects and the people who use it. Of course the problem with stereotypes is that it leads into the problem illustrated by Lemert, create self-fulfilling prophecies, incorporate it as part of your identity, push people further into that behavior.
  
* **Neutralizations** -> Norm evasions (from the point of the view of the deviant, it's valid). Some behaviors are much easier to justify, and some norms are easier to evade. Pre-behavioral justifications, they help you overcome those norms and also help you overcome the negative stereotypes of that behaviors. Additionally protects one's self-conception (how one wishes to view one's self). In terms of DA, they're messages favorable to breaking the law.
  
* **Conduct norms** -> Definitions of rightness/wrongness of certain behaviors, variation in the strength of the norms amongst groups of people. These norms are going to be more or less favorable to criminal behavior. E.g. "shared" conception of the appropriateness of violence.
  
* **Sanctions** - Part of how strongly or weakly organized the messages of anti-criminal behavior are. White collar crime -> weak sanctions, lots of neutralizations, friends won't turn you in, weakly/ambiguous enforcement, neutral or even positive stereotypes.
* **Attitudes/Beliefs about the law**
	* Normative conflict -> differential social organization -> organizations strongly/weakly organized for/against pro-social and anti-social behavior -> involves sanctions as well -> but also the norms at the individual level, what's required of you (anticipated rewards and punishments from the different groups you're a part of).

Again, remember this all comes from people interacting and the differential in our interactions. Some might argue civilization has increased the strength of norms organized against violence. Thus we've become less violent, violence is concentrated in the hands of the government.

Back to our original programming.

* Organizations of people are going to promote certain norms and values which govern behavior in the group e.g. murder is wrong, stealing is wrong.
  
* Those who behave contrary to the norms are stereotyped e.g. drug users are lazy addicts, thieves are untrustworthy deadbeats who have to steal from hardworking, honest folk.
  
* In addition to official sanctions, violations of norms and values also result in unofficial sanctions. Things like loss of prestige and status, loss of certain privileges, ostracization from certain aspects of society. Stereotypes and sanctions work in conjunction to ensure conformity with norms and values.

Now, of course, even in organizations which promote conforming, prosocial behavior there will be exceptions carved out. Murder is wrong unless it’s in self-defense or you’re in war as a soldier. Stealing is wrong unless you’re starving and have no other means of gaining sustenance.

* In deviant behaviors, similar exceptions occur. People often rationalize after the fact, but they will also rationalize or neutralize their actions beforehand convincing themselves they’re adhering to the norms/values of conforming society. They’re not the stereotype of the people who commit the criminal behavior. E.g it was an accident, nobody got hurt, they’re so rich it doesn’t matter that I stole. Allows people to have their cake and eat it too as it were.
  
* In some cases, people may move past the need for neutralization. This can happen for a variety of concrete reasons, but abstractly, the norms, values, and stereotypes or messages and associations of conformity have become weakly organized against those in favor of criminality which are now more strongly organized. This produces the excess of associations mentioned earlier leading to criminal behavior.
  
* By moving past the need for neutralization, individuals will have become enmeshed in a subculture whose associations and messages of criminal behavior isolate or attenuate the individual from associations and messages of conformity. This is the idea of strong and weak organization mentioned earlier.

I’d like to take a moment to clarify that messages can be communicated verbally and explicitly, but they’re also communicated implicitly through actions and us interpreting the content of those actions in terms of the ideas latent in them. E.g. think of a child who sees their otherwise law-abiding, norm adhering father hit his mother in an act of domestic abuse. The father may disavow violence, but his actions teach the child a different message.

## Describing the Marijuana User

One can imagine somebody trying to smoke marijuana for the first time. They’ll be afraid because of official sanctions but also unofficial sanctions. They’ll be afraid they will turn into the popular stereotype of a marijuana user. There may be other things they’ll be afraid of as well. Regardless, exposure to enough counter-messages and associations from friends and peers will convince them to try it. To assuage their fears, they’ll engage in some neutralization techniques to convince themselves they aren’t the stereotype and thus won’t receive the unofficial sanctions (e.g. I’ll just try it once, all my friends are trying it and they’re not stereotypes).

The person tries it and may find they like it or not. Depending on subsequent frequency, duration, and intensity (the modalities of learning) of associations and messages, the person will learn about smoking marijuana: how to smoke it, how to roll a joint, how to enjoy it most fully. All these things are pro-deviant messages around the use of marijuana. These messages breakdown stereotypes, and they lessen fear of sanctions since repeated usage has seen no repercussions. They may also serve to isolate the individual from anti-marijuana messages and associations. Thus the messages of conforming are becoming weaker or more weakly organized and the messages of deviancy are becoming stronger or more strongly organized.

For some people who become regular users, they may no longer need to employ techniques of neutralization. They will no longer care about suffering the official and unofficial sanctions from using marijuana, or, stated differently, they will care more about adhering to the norms and standards of their marijuana subcultural group. The potential rewards and anticipated punishments of their marijuana subcultural group feature more prominently in their mind than those of the larger culture.

A few concluding notes concerning the above example…  

* As briefly alluded to in various parts of this talk, differential association is a general theory of crime which can be used to explain all classes of criminal behavior. Through careful empirical analysis, one can reproduce the sort of scenario I was talking about concerning marijuana usage. The details will differ but the structure supplied by theory will remain the same.
  
* It’s important to emphasize that differential association argues that subcultures reflect a difference of degree from mainstream culture values. They do not have totally different values. Using our marijuana example again… In mainstream society we value relaxation and leisure and having fun. Certain drugs are already legal allowing us to do so (alcohol, caffeine, nicotine). Additionally, we allow and promote the use of drugs to manage pain and many drugs exist already which allow us to do so (ibuprofen, aspirin).
  
* Finally the above scenario was only describing one aspect of an individual. Nobody is fully deviant in all aspects of life or fully conforming in all aspects of life. The above individual while deviating through using marijuana may conform in other ways.

## Akers’ extension of differential association - Social Learning

![[steffensmeier_akers_crim512.jpg]]

1. Akers largely accepts Sutherland’s theory and views himself as expanding upon it. Specifically Akers expands upon how people learn messages and definitions conducive to crime or conformity.
   
	1. **Differential reinforcement**: I mentioned this briefly at the end of the marijuana example. Individuals based on past experience will anticipate greater rewards than punishment by engaging in certain behaviors vs. other behaviors. Of course, the relative worth of a punishment or reward will be shaped by prior learning and associations in an iterative, reciprocating process.
	2. **Stimulus generalization**: Various overt/covert, verbal/cognitive, explicit/implicit stimuli will be cues and prime an individual to either engage in conforming or deviant behavior in a process not dissimilar to conditioning as described by Skinner.
	3. **Imitation**: Related to the idea we learn through observing explicit as well as implicit behaviors and messages, this learning pattern allows for learning from various forms of mass media (television, internet, video games, movies).
	4. Unrelated to learning, Akers argues differential association/social learning must be conceived of probabilistically rather than absolutely as Sutherland originally envisioned.  
      
## Criticisms and Responses
    
An often brought up critique or complaint of differential association/social learning theory is that it cannot be empirically tested let alone measured. It certainly isn’t possible to empirically test the whole theory (much like all sociological theory), but it is possible to test specific hypotheses and empirical implications which would result from the theory. To that end, researchers have ingeniously found a number of ways to measure aspects of the theory.

1. **Differential peer association**: Measuring the number or proportion of peers involved in delinquency while also measuring modalities (frequency and duration). Important to mention again this isn’t solely peer pressure/peer influence at work.
2. **Survey measures of definitions**: Through survey responses, one can ascertain one’s internal views concerning the acceptability of various criminal behavior.
3. **Survey measures of differential reinforcement**: Through survey responses one can measure and understand an individual’s subjective weighing of the rewards/punishments for conforming/rule-breaking.
4. **Structural equation modeling**: Statistical techniques have been developed to allow for the measurement of unobservable, latent constructs through observable implications of that construct. In this case, it has allowed for researchers to directly get at measures of the differential in differential association.
5. Additionally, these measures of differential association have been found to hold when other factors of crime are present (race, sex, age, socioeconomic status) and thus help explain to why these factors are typically seen as being explantory factors of crime. E.g. people of less fortunate socioeconomic status have an excess of messages favorable to criminal behavior, masculinity, and in particular the idea of toxic masculinity, promotes messages favorable to criminal behavior.

## Applications of Differential Association/Social Learning and Policy implications

In whatever specific area of crime you study, I urge you to consider the questions posed by differential association/social learning theory:

1. Which individuals are interacting the most with each other? What behaviors do they engage in? What sort of messages do those behaviors communicate as to the legitimacy of criminal behavior?
2. How do individuals subjectively weight the rewards of their criminal behavior vs. the potential costs? How can this weighing of rewards and punishments be traced back to their learned associations and messages?
3. Consider doing a deep dive interview on the life of the individual. Consider their home and family life and how they played a role in inculcating pro-criminal or anti-criminal messages. Consider then the ripple effects from this early learning and how it affected future associations. This may be harder to do, and it will be harder to generalize and replicate. 
    
To conclude, I would like to discuss an important policy implication of differential association/social learning theory.

1. To change individual behavior, you also need to change the group behavior which the individual associates most differentially with. You can also change the groups the individual associates most differentially with. [[cresseyChangingCriminalsApplication1955]].
2. Trying to reform individuals in isolation like in the medical model will not be fruitful.
3. By either changing the original group an individual associates with or attempting to get the individual to associate with new groups, it’s important the new group practices [[retroflexive reformation]] wherein criminals are induced to join with non-criminals for the purpose of changing other criminals. Those in need of reform achieve it for themselves by helping others achieve it. A very powerful tool for teaching individuals messages favorable to conformity.

## Notes from Darrell Steffensmeier's CRIM512

### Darrell's Lecture Notes

### Hard vs. Soft Culture

* Some theorists took a hard view on the oppositional culture stuff others took a softer view.
	* Hard view -> subcultures are always oppositional to and distinct from the dominant culture. it has very different norms and values which may lead to a tolerance for crime.
	* Soft view -> Subcultures are connected to the dominant culture and may take a variety of positions in relation to the dominant culture. Delinquent behavior may have its roots in the dominant culture's ideals which the subculture merely tweaks or extends. The dominant culture's influence over the subculture can be covert and diffuse.
* ![[steffensmeier_hard-vs-soft-culture_crim512.jpg]]

### Normative and Cultural Conflict

* We are a society made up of a number of subcultures which hold different values and attitudes toward proper behavior. These different subcultures mold the behavior of individuals who make up the subculture.
* This can lead to normative conflict. Cultural message can be: supportive, neutral, contradictory/mixed, strongly supportive or not supportive of crime. The influence of these cultural messages depends on their modalities.
