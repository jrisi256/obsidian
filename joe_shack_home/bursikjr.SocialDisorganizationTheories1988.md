## Abstract

After a period of decline in the discipline, the [[Social disorganization]] model of [[Shaw and McKay]] is again beginning to appear in the literature. This paper examines five criticisms of the perspective and discusses recent attempts to address those issues and problems that are still in need of resolution.

## My notes

- Social disorganization (SD) had been in decline and neglected, but it has recently attracted scholarly attention again. Addresses 5 criticisms of social disorganization. Discusses attempts to remedy them and what challenges/problems remain.

- **Theory** → Areas of low socioeconomic status tend to have higher rates of population turnover (abandon these areas as soon as they can) combined with population heterogeneity → leads to social disorganization and a lack of social control. “Inability of local communities to realize their common values or solve common problems.” → Residents have little stake in the area so do not invest in mechanisms of control, development of primary relationships which would result in informal social control also do not develop, heterogeneity impedes communication.
	- Freely draw upon other theories to really define the mechanisms. Although Bursik claims it is best thought of as an instantiation of [[social control theory]].

### Criticisms
- **Part 1** → Some criticize it for its lack of ability to make individual predictions. However, this isn’t really a good criticism. Long history in [[Criminology]] of focusing on groups.
- **Part 2** → Criticism of the assumption of stable ecological structures. So we have begun to use longitudinal data sources more and more.
- **Part 3** → How do you measure social disorganization? Must clearly differentiate between the outcome (increased rates of delinquency) and the construct → Ability for a community to regulate itself through formal and informal processes of social control. Of course, it’s very hard to measure all these things → can really only concentrate on a few communities at a time, survey measures.
	- Informal [[surveillance]], movement-governing rules (avoiding unsafe areas), direct intervention → **supervisory**.
	- Focus not just on control but subcultures and how people learn behaviors which get deemed more or less acceptable → **socialization**.
- **Part 4** → Criticizing crime data. <mark>Is this unique to this theory?</mark> #highlight
- **Part 5** → Normative assumptions of social disorganization. Insensitive to the realities of political and economic life. However, it doesn’t appear so normative to assume residents want a life free from crime (and only assumption that’s needed, no other assumptions about commonly held values in other outcomes is needed i.e. education or family unit structure).
	- Regardless, this model may not hold for not serious crimes (or things which are contested as criminal) and very serious crimes or white-collar crime → however we could substitute an organization for a community and see how results replicate. Or not.
	- More damning are critiques that the theory does not consider broader economic and political trends. But we can expand.
    
### Innovations
- **Innovation 1** → Link the group-level and individual-level theories. Consider the [[neighborhood]] as context for individual-level behavior. How does the neighborhood affect the individual?
- **Innovation 2** → [[Victimology]]. Connected to routine activities and how cities are designed.
- **Innovation 3** → Considering simultaneity in how crime weakens a community’s ability to regulate itself.
