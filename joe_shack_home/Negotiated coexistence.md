* See [[browningIlluminatingDownsideSocial2009]] for a more detailed explanation of the theory.
* As network interaction and reciprocated exchange among neighborhood residents increase, offenders and conventional residents become increasingly interdependent. In turn, the social capital provided by network integration of offenders may diminish the regulatory effectiveness of collective efficacy.
* Conflicts with the [[systemic model]] and [[cultural transmission]] theories which typically predict that all forms of social interaction and dense network ties are always good for inhibiting crime and exerting informal social control.
* Theory was developed due to the observation that many neighborhoods have high social cohesion but also high crime.
