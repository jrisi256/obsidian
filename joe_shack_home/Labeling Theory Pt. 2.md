## Class 1 - Lemert

### Background and Context for Lemert and the Interactionist Labeling Perspective
    
Lemert was responding to the current state of Sociology at the time. He was calling out the **moralistic undertones** which undergirded its study. Early Sociologists often came from rural, small-town America and usually with a Protestant upbringing. This perspective informed their work, guided their research, helped them determine what ailed society, and led them to solutions.
    
From Lemert’s perspective, this was unscientific. To develop into a mature science, Sociology needed to be built up through a combination of empirical rigor and careful theorization **without appeals to morals or values**. Objects of study needed to be dealt with neutrally.
    
This background thinking is also important for understanding Lemert’s main theory. In addition to thinking Sociology needed to be less value-laden, he also believed there was an important area of study being overlooked. The problems of society were being defined by some group which led to a problematization of certain behaviors and patterns which weren’t previously problems (at least in the sense that they weren’t pointed out as a systematic problem). This **problem-defining behavior** struck Lemert as at least as important as the problematic behavior itself.
    
Lemert was also writing during the 1960’s in the USA which was a time of enormous upheaval. Traditional systems of authority (like the state, the police, and the prison system) had their validity and efficacy being questioned. Deviants and criminals began to be seen in the public’s eye as **underdogs** and **oppressed** by overarching societal structures and an overbearing government. Since Lemert’s theories questioned the effect of traditional criminal justice responses to crime, his theories had a receptive audience in academia as well as the public. 

### Concepts

**Actions and Norms** - Before we get into the guts of theory we need to establish some of the background assumptions and ideas Lemert is using to further motivate his theories.
    
* Persons and groups have certain regularities of behavior, but there is differentiation and variation in the behavior. Some behavior is far from the average or norm, or it isn’t within the normal bounds of variation. This type of behavior elicits a response from society: _positive_, _indifferent_, or _negative_.
  
* Societal response to the _deviation_ will vary according to a variety of factors:
	* How strongly does the community adhere to the norm being violated?
	* How damaging, generally, is the action to others and to the actor?
	* How visible is the action to others not participating in it?
	* _Who_ is committing the deviation? By this it is meant that society responds differentially to the same action based on a person’s biology, personality, and other traits and characteristics (e.g. race, class, sex, gender, sexual orientation).
	* Communities are also situated in a _time_ and a _place_. This means norms change over time, and they’re different from community to community.
	  
* As mentioned before society can react to the deviation in a variety of ways:
  
	* **Positive**: The community could be wholly integrative of the new behavior. The deviance is now taken to be a part of the normal variation in behavior. See modern society and how it’s taken interracial marriage, homosexuality, and transsexuality as _normal variation_ today.
	  
	* **Indifference**: Tacitly allow the deviation while nominally disapproving of it. One example of this response can be modern views in the USA concerning gambling. Many people see it as a vice but not enough to seriously curb it (although in some cases it has been). Other times the deviant behavior is too woven into the fabric of society to completely remove (see collusion and corruption between politicians and business leaders).
	  
	* **Negative**: Wholly disapproves of the action and works to stop the behavior as much as possible. 
    
**Societal Reaction and the Application of the Label** - Lemert’s theory is primarily concerned with when society reacts negatively to deviation and attempts to stop the behavior. Specifically **the social audience** becomes the target of the study. This was alluded to in the previous section, but Lemert is concerned with: **1)** Why does society label certain individuals or actions as deviant? **2)** What effect does curbing that behavior actually have? Focusing on the second question for now, Lemert proposes society’s negative reaction to deviations actually perpetuates the deviant behavior and doesn’t curtail it.

* ***Primary and Secondary Deviation**
	* **Primary Deviation** - This is the original deviant action e.g. drinking to excess. There are many reasons why someone might drink to excess: their wife died, they're having trouble at work or at home or in school, they’re celebrating some achievement they just accomplished.
	  
	* In some cases the primary deviation will engender a **societal response** usually a sanction of some sort. It doesn’t have to be an official sanction although it can be. It could be people judging you, stigmatizing you, stereotyping you. You might be ostracized for your behavior. E.g. in the drinking example let’s say you acted inappropriately towards a coworker or a member of the opposite sex. Perhaps you made a mess of somebody’s car or apartment or the bar. People will react negatively to this.
	  
	* If the societal reaction is severe enough, individuals may be **blocked from fulfilling their goals and aspirations**, and they may be blocked from fully participating in society to the extent they would like.
	  
	* The individual can then resort to further **deviancy** to fulfill their blocked goals and aspirations. They may also be feeling a sense of indignation for being treated so harshly. They do not feel as if the crime is proportionate to the deviance (if they even think punishment was necessary).
	  
	* Continual **deviations** will be met with further **negative societal reactions and sanctions**.
	  
	* At this point, the individual will have **reorganized their identity** so as to include their deviancy as a core part of their identity. This fulfills several objectives. It protects the actor’s self-esteem and conception of self. Nobody wants to view themselves as a bad person, and they’ll take steps to not see themselves as such. The creation and acceptance of the new identity also allows for individuals to fully achieve their goals or aspirations or devise new goals and aspirations that are more achievable given their current identity.
	  
* This outlined process is how society reinforces the behavior it seeks to eliminate. It cuts off opportunities for those labelled deviant, and those labelled as such continue to engage in the activity despite the social penalties it incurs because they’ve been blocked for satisfying their goals in acceptable ways. To protect their self-conception, they reorganize their identity around the deviancy. 

**Interaction** - Lest it seem totally deterministic, Lemert stresses the labeling is a _negotiated interaction_ between those doing the labeling (society) and those being labelled (the _offender_). Thus there are several important factors which come into play when determining the effects of a label as well as who gets labelled (which was touched on a bit earlier but will be expanded upon here).

* **Internal and External Limits**: Individuals have physical, biological, and personality based limits on the role they _can_ accept and are _willing_ to accept. A person’s physical and biological traits can lead to physical constraints on the role the person can accept. A person’s personality can lead to attitudinal and moral constraints on the roles they’re willing to accept. There are also external limits in the person’s environment which structure what roles and labels are available to them. This can mean limits based on one’s identity and status e.g. certain opportunities just aren’t open to people based on their race, class, or sex because of discrimination. It can also refer to more physical limitations (it’s impossible to become a drug user if there are no drugs sold in your area).
  
* This can lead to people rejecting the label and the behavior which led to that label. As mentioned before, it may also _involve_ **negotiation**. How much leeway does the actor have in their actions? Maybe they can continue to engage in it if they make it less visible? The societal response can also be negotiated on the basis of further interaction. Society can learn more about the offense and decide it may not be as harmful as originally thought. Society may also double down and come to the conclusion the action is actually harmful.
  
* The internal and external limits the person is working within in conjunction with their label also serve to **constrain their choices**. E.g. as a result of being labelled an alcoholic, you have your license revoked. You need to get work still though. Your choices become constrained, and you have to take risks and do further deviant actions depending on what your higher order values are. You negotiate with yourself about what you value and what you’re willing to risk. Such actions can push people further into deviancy. It’s another example of how society perpetuates the behavior it seeks to eliminate.
  
* **Power**: Why do certain actions get labelled as deviant? We discussed earlier some factors which can come to bear on the situation (visibility, harmfulness, characteristics of the offender). Lemert also wishes to emphasize that rule-making is also **a process** much like labelling is. In this case, rule-making is a negotiated process between groups.

* For Lemert, rules form as the result of group interactions in which abstract values are translated into concrete conditions in the world. Certainly groups with more power will get more of their values written into law, but it won’t get all its values translated into law. Part of this is because of competing groups. Another part of this is they may find they have conflicting norms and some norms must be sacrificed so other values can remain. There will also be resource constraints so when certain values get translated into rules they may find there aren't actually enough resources in place to enforce those rules.

* In conclusion, the decision to label certain actors and actions as deviant as well as the labeling itself are _continual, negotiated, processes_. They aren’t predetermined outcomes. They result from **the interactions of humans**, and humans’ attempts to translate values into action within the constraints they have to work within.
    
## Class 2 - The Influence of Lemert and The Interactionist Labelling Perspective

Lemert’s ideas and theory have influenced quite a few researchers, and they have inspired many different avenues of research. We will be going over some of them here.

### **Becker & Moral Entrepreneurs**

[[beckerOutsidersStudiesSociology1963]]

Not all rules are enforced equally. Some rules aren’t enforced because they are too cumbersome to be enforced. Other times it may be in the interest of the enforcing party to not enforce the rules (a company lets an employee steal food rather than pay them more money so they wouldn’t have to steal).
    
It should be evident then there are reasons for differential rule enforcement and differential translation of values into rules. There is a class of people who appear from time to time called **moral entrepreneurs** who take it upon themselves to translate certain values into new rules. They identify or classify pre-existing behaviors as problematic and in need of a solution and thus make it deviant.
    
Successful moral entrepreneurs are able to institutionalize their crusade and create a new class of **rule enforcers**. Rule enforcers don’t share in the zeal the moral entrepreneurs had concerning the problematic behavior. Constant interaction with rulebreakers makes them cynical, but their interest in keeping their position also ensures they remain cynical about the prospects of truly solving the problem.
    
Rule enforcers also must prioritize also to enforce the rule because they cannot enforce every instance of rule-breaking. This becomes a perfect illustration of the **negotiated process** Becker mentioned which is involved in the creation and enforcement of rules. The rule enforcers are very likely going to have different priorities and values than the rule creators did.
    
### Lofland - Deviance as a threat and as a response to threats

Deviance is a type of social conflict wherein some actors and parties designate that which they are **afraid of and feel threatened by**. The successful labelling of an action as deviant will depend on several factors of the groups involved: the degree to which they are organized, their population size, how strong is the fear, how much economic and social power do the groups have. It follows that the degree to which certain peoples and their activities get sanctioned depends on their ability to marshal resources to convince the public/convince the democratic governance to do something about it.
    
Deviant acts are also attempts by individuals to manage threat in their lives:
    
* **Defensive Deviant Act**: The actor feels threatened and feels like they need to respond to threat to protect themselves. The threat can be to their physical or material well-being, or it can be to their social well-being (e.g. their reputation may be threatened).
  
	- Three phases of the defensive deviant act
	  
		- The **threat** is perceived whether it be of the physical or social kind. It’s important to note the destruction of the social self is an attack on self-constructed social meaning based on socially constructed categories. E.g. there is no physical indicator or objective fact that we are a _trustworthy_ person. It’s established through interaction. However when these categories are threatened we react as if our own physical well-being were in danger.
		  
		- **Encapsulation** - The next step in a deviant action where the actor becomes fixated on the threat. The intense focus leads to a constriction of the range of perceptible actions. This could be called the human fight or flight instinct. It can also be the case we aren’t able to share with others the problems we’re facing and thus cannot rely upon social support to mediate our response and help us consider non-deviant actions.
		  
		- **Closure** - The set of actions most immediately available and performable will be executed.
		  
- **Adventurous Deviant Act**: We also act in deviant ways when threat levels fall below a certain level. Uncertainty, fear, and threats (when manageable) can be fun. It’s pleasantly threatening. Much of juvenile delinquency is done for this reason (looking for fun and thrills). 

### Quinney and Conflict Theory

Quinney takes Lemert’s ideas concerning power and rulemaking and applies them using a Marxist lens of class conflict.
    
**Definition of Crime** - Crime as a legal definition of human conduct is created by agents of the dominant class in a politically organized society. Crime is not inherent in behavior, but it is a judgment made about actions and characteristics of others.
    
**Formulating Definitions of Crime** - Definitions of crime are composed of behaviors that conflict with the interests of the dominant class. These will change as the interests of the dominant class change. The interests of the powerful are not only reflected in the definitions of crime and the kinds of penal sanctions attached to them, but also in the rules created for enforcing and administering them, for treating and punishing the criminal, and for preventing and controlling crime.
    
**Applying Definitions of Crime** - Definitions of crime are applied by the class that has the power to shape the enforcement and administration of criminal law. “Crime is political behavior and the criminal is part of a minority group without sufficient public support to dominate control of the police power of the state.” The probability that the definitions are applied varies according to how much the powerless threaten the powerful.

**How Behavior Patterns Develop in Relation to Definitions of Crime** - People create their own personal action patterns which are formed in participating with others (structured opportunities, learning experiences, interpersonal association, self-conceptions). Being defined as a criminal (which is more likely to happen among those who are powerless for they cannot set the rules) leads to self-identification as a criminal and a learning of how to play the criminal role. Increased experience with definitions of crime increases the probability of developing actions which may be defined as criminal which leads to creation of a criminal self-identity. The definers of crime and criminally defined are involved in reciprocal action patterns. One influences the other which then in turns causes a reverse effect.
    
**Ideology of Crime** - It is constructed and diffused by the dominant class to maintain hegemony. Concepts of crime are accompanied with ideas about the nature of crime, relevance of crime, offender characteristics, appropriate reaction to crime, and they are spread through communication and media networks. Ideology of crime is also formed by state investigations and state law (defines what are the problem actions and how we’re going to deal with it). Thus the state in many ways picks who the criminals are to be.

Quinney’s ideas are quite provocative, and Lemert would sometimes take issue with the Marxist perspective because it was a bit too deterministic for Lemert’s tastes. In Lemert’s eyes, it ignored how rule-making and labelling is a process. Certainly power plays a role, but it's too simplistic a framework to adequately describe and understand the totality of the process. Nevertheless the conflict theory perspective is powerful, and it still informs much research today. 
    
### Goffman and Stigma

Goffman’s work helped produce insights into how a label can go on to produce or not produce deviance. It dives deep into the process by which individuals are labelled and react to that label.
    
Through repeated social intercourse humans have developed the ability to size up others from first appearances. It’s a cognitive shortcut which allows us to anticipate others’ social categories and attributes often based on stereotypes and assumptions.
    
We construct a virtual social identity which may or may not be the same as their actual social identity. **Stigma** is when the person possesses an attribute which makes them lesser than they otherwise normally would be for someone in their perceived social category.
    
What makes something a stigma though depends on the **context** (some jobs are seen as appropriate given a certain educational level while the same job may make one seem like a failure if they held it while holding a high degree of education). **Stigma is a relationship between attribute and stereotype**.
    
Stigma can be physical, a social trait, or group-based (race, religion, nation). Stigmatized individuals are often treated as less than fully human. Humans will construct ways to explain their assumed inferiority and our rightful hostile actions. We also attribute other attributes to the person with the stigma not stemming from the original stigma (e.g. people often shout at blind people).
    
There are a wide variety of reactions people have to being stigmatized:
* Some hold their stigma as not a stigma (e.g. I’m proud to be a redneck).
* Others do see their stigma as stigma and are deeply ashamed of it. There is a lack of acceptance of themselves, and oftentimes they look inward and echo the denial as being warranted.
* In some rare cases individuals can fix their stigma (e.g. abstaining from alcohol when labelled as an alcoholic).
* In many cases, people with stigma learn to accept it and live with it. It becomes a part of their identity, and they don’t see themselves as being somehow lesser than otherwise labelled _normal_ people. E.g. the handicapped community particularly during the Civil Rights era sought to establish civil rights for themselves, and they sought to demonstrate to broader society they weren’t any lesser than the able-bodied. It was the able-bodied who needed to adjust their assumptions and stereotypes about what the handicapped could do. 
    
### Promising Future Avenues of Research
    
Historical and comparative analyses concerning the development of deviant labels. This is known as **social constructionism** which is meant to communicate the idea that societal problems are created by people as a result of our interactions. Problems are _created_ and _not_ _discovered_. If they are _discovered_, it is because some new concept is being invoked which problematizes the previously unproblematized behavior.

* The **medicalization of deviance** or the invention of medical labels for deviants which allows for the deviance to be treated medically, and it has even expanded into non-deviant behaviors e.g. sexual dysfunction and menopause.
  
* The **social construction of modern crimes**. Crimes like stalking and hate crimes are recently constructed types of crimes. Research into this area asks how did these behaviors become labelled as deviant and why now.
    
Dynamics and consequences of stigma and labeling (Goffman’s work is very much in this category). Labeling doesn’t _simply_ produce further deviance. There are intervening processes that themselves generate further involvement (and in some cases desistance).

* **Self-labeling**: What are the processes by which individuals come to label themselves? E.g. people freely admitting to being an alcoholic and accepting they have a disease.
    
Investigations into the operation of social agencies as they process deviants, how they label certain individuals as deviants, and how they seek to manage deviance. 

* **David Sudnow**: Prosecutors and public defenders work together to match an offender’s conduct to an official legal category. Both parties have a shared interest in routinizing the work, and the ambiguity in definitions of crime leaves a lot of discretion on how to charge individuals in the hands of the lawyers..
    
- **Richard McCleary**: Parole agents ignore deviant behavior of parolees unless they see some benefit in being able to control the parolee or to satisfy formal/informal bureaucratic demands.
    
- **Foucault**: Social control decision making is dependent upon broader historical trends in social control ideology and practices. Technologies and strategies employed by social control institutions reflect broader discourses about government and the moral order of society. Social control organizations are conduits then of the latent ideology in any given time period concerning how to best manage deviance.
	- How does ideology which govern the social control institutions differ from the actual practice and administration of controlling deviance?
	- Need to understand how labeling is translated from broader ideologies into local situations contingent upon local knowledge and beliefs, competing ideologies, and organizational and environmental constraints. 
    
## Class 3 - Examples of the Labelling Perspective in Contemporary Research and Policy Making

 That was a lot of heady theory we just worked through. It will be helpful to exemplify some contemporary research which puts the labelling perspective into practice and attempts to work through the implications of the theory. 

### The Construction of Social Problems
    
#### The Missing Child Problem

We all know about Amber alerts and missing children being featured on milk boxes. These systems didn’t always exist. They had to be created. _Missing children_ as a distinct category and problem had to be constructed. Of course objectively children have always been going missing. However it took some, shall we say **moral entrepreneurs**, to classify and create a set of behaviors as constituting a _missing child_. Specifically the researchers investigated how missing children were constructed as a problem of argumentation.
    
- There is a **claim** or conclusion whose merits one seeks to establish. There are facts or **grounds** for what one is claiming (i.e. data). Finally there are **warrants** which link data to specific actions which need to be taken.
    
- Grounds are established by creating **definitions** (identifies a phenomenon and sets boundaries on what does and does not constitute the social problem in question), providing **examples** (tactically selected to be emotionally stimulating), and by **estimating the extent of the problem** (numerical estimates concerning how widespread the problem is, estimates of how the problem is growing).
    
- **Warrants** are ways of connecting the data to actions which need to be taken (according to the moral entrepreneur) to rectify the problem. In the case of missing children children were made to be blameless victims. Current policies were deficient in dealing with the problem (the FBI didn’t investigate missing children unless a ransom or other compelling evidence was procured). This leads to awareness campaigns (milk cartons, billboards, amber alerts), prevention measures (fingerprint your children), and new social control policies leading to new labels for this deviant behavior.
    
#### The Role Media Plays in Constructing Problems and Labels
    
The Harris research paper you were to have prepared for class illustrates this issue quite nicely. Despite empirical research demonstrating immigrants have _lower_ crime rates than the native population, the public believes immigration increases crime and the foreign born are prone to offending.
    
An in-depth analysis of newspaper articles on immigration from 1990 to 2013 found nearly 62% of all articles used an “immigrants are criminals” framing or “undocumented immigration is a crime” framing.
    
These stories run counter to the facts which shows immigrants are less crime prone and undocumented immigration isn’t a crime.
    
This research shows how individuals and the public don’t base their stereotypes on facts. It also shows how attributes not inherent in the label can get associated with the label. Nothing in being an immigrant would suggest you are a criminal, but that is the attribute conjured up with that label in current American society.
    
#### The Negotiated Process By Which Labels Are Applied - Schwartz, Steffensmeier, and Feldmeyer
    
Arrest statistics for aggravated and simple assaults were on the rise for women in the 1990’s. The research done in this paper demonstrated this was not due to objective changes in women’s behavior, but it was instead due to shifting social control mechanisms and changes in the mobilization of the law. Many more types of behaviors became categorized as violent crime as a result.
    
During this period of time, the USA was undergoing a _Get Tough_ in how it dealt with crime which meant more behavior was getting labelled as deviant and those labelled deviant were getting treated harsher.
    
At the same time feminist and victim right’s groups were pushing for greater social intolerance of all forms of violence particularly against women in the home and the school. This led to an expansion of the police into homes and schools.
    
As a demonstration of the _**negotiated process**_ of labelling and how dominant interest groups cannot always predict how their values will translate into actions, there was a lot of discretion left in the hands of police as to what constituted an arrestable offense in cases of domestic violence. This zone of discretion led to police arresting more women for behaviors which previously they would not have been arrested for.
    
### Policy Positions
    
#### Hidden Sentences - Kaiser
    
During imprisonment, probation, and other penal supervision, offenders are subject to myriad restrictions on their civil, political, and social rights including limited speech, religious exercise, privacy, and spousal and parental rights. They can be excluded from occupations and welfare and from living in certain locations. These forms of **extra-criminal sentencing** make up the part of the offender’s punishment hidden from public and professional view. These are all punishments the law imposes as a direct result of criminal status but not as a part of a formally recognized judge-imposed sentence.
    
These hidden sentences are more objective manifestations of what happens when one becomes labelled. Certain avenues of life are shut off from you, and you cannot effectively be reintegrated into society. You must continually turn to deviance to satisfy yourself, and you continue to organize your identity around this deviance.
    
Your vulnerability also leaves you quite open to exploitation from others who would take advantage of your limited prospects. There is also a lot of  anger/resentment which can build up. The punishment continues forever, and it is disproportionate to the offense.
    
These **hidden sentences** must be brought into the light and made a part of the formal sanction (if they’re even still considered appropriate once brought to light). Individuals must **reintegrated** into society for them to desist from deviance. They cannot be continually excluded and yet expected to turn away from deviance.
    
#### Drug Policy - Lindesmith & Ray
    
Drug addiction does not result from moral weakness or a weak will. There are observable sociological conditions under which addiction can be accurately predicted as to whether or not it will occur. Addiction is generated in the process of using the drug consciously to alleviate withdrawal distress. If an individual fails to recognize the connection between their withdrawal stress and the drug, they escape addiction.
    
Labeling drug addicts as somehow reprehensible or responsible for their predicament pushes them further into addiction and deviance because it fails to address the underlying issue. The labelling of drug addicts ostracizes them from mainstream society and has led to the creation of subculture of drug addiction.
    
Drug addicts organize their life around addiction as a result. It gives them status, an identity, and a network of peers.
    
Being physically free from addiction happens for drug addicts fairly frequently. However the hostile reactions from people in their social circles makes them feel ostracized. They cannot integrate back into society. While they know drugs are bad for them, their old identity and status are seen as preferable to their current situation in which they’re pariahs.
    
Drug policy much like criminal justice policy must be organized around these facts. Individuals must be reintegrated back into society so as to help them successfully desist from their deviant behavior. Further punishment will only serve to push them further into deviancy and solidify their deviant identities.

## Concluding Remarks

1. Deviancy is as much if not more so a product of the social audience versus the offender.
    
2. Once the social audience has a negative reaction to a specific act, they engage in labelling the offender as such. This sets into motion a **negotiated process** between the offender and the social audience wherein the offender struggles to form a new identity which incorporates devinacy, or they try to keep their old pre-deviance identity.
    
3. Much like labelling is a process so is the making of rules. Rules are made by groups coming together and translating their conflicting values into concrete actions. This too is a negotiation subject to power differentials and environmental/resource constraints. It will also be limited by practical considerations of enforcement.
    
4. Crime then is as much a product of social construction if not more so as it as a reaction to objectively harmful actions.
