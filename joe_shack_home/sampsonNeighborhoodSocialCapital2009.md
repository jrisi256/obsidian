## Abstract

This article treats social capital as a multidimensional phenomenon along which neighborhoods are differentially organized. The authors assess this notion by linking two original surveys carried out in Chicago based on community residents (N = 8,782) and positional leaders (N = 2,822) representing six organizational dimensions. These data are used to examine both the dimensionality and structural predictors of neighborhood social organization. Results show that the social capital of Chicago communities encapsulates four distinct dimensions at the residential level and two at the leadership level. Moreover, dimensions of leadership-based social capital are for the most part inversely related to resident-based social capital and differentially predicted by concentrated disadvantage, residential stability, and racial/ethnic diversity. Based on multidimensional scaling and clustering of the communities, the authors derive a conceptual typology highlighted by four distinct groups—Cosmopolitan Efficacy, Urban Villages, Institutional Alienation, and Conduct Norms. The authors discuss implications and suggest new directions for exploration of community differentiation.

Disadvantage also does not work as expected in predicting all dimensions of social capital. For local networks and conduct norms, disadvantage appears not to be a significant predictor net of other structural indices (also see Sampson et al., 1999; Sampson &amp; Groves, 1989). The implication is that, to the extent that network ties and conduct norms are positive predictors of community well-being, interventions to improve such dimensions of social capital may not be impeded by the level of community disadvantage or racial/ethnic heterogeneity in a significant way. Furthermore, the nonsignificant associations between stabil-”</span> <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F8411795%2Fitems%2F2GA5BJ2W%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221600%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D">(<span class="citation-item">Sampson and Graif, 2009, p. 1600</span>)</span> Disadvantage and heterogeneity aren't always impediments.
