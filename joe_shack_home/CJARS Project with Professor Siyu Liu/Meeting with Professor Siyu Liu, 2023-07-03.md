## Project Overview

### Part 1

Linking [[CJARS]] with [[MDAC]] (Mortality in American Communities). MDAC followed people in the 2008 [[ACS ]]wave for 7 years and tracked how many of them died. Recorded cause of death. We can, hopefully, link these individuals to CJARS. This would give us knowledge on the correlations between justice-involved individuals, individual socioeconomic and demographic traits, and causes of death.

Unfortunately, we do not know the overlap between the two data sets.

This part is focused on understanding the mortality of justice involved people. Specifically, we would like to compare the mortality of justice involved people to the general population. It would be the first national-level analysis of justice involved individuals. This would seek to replicate findings from other countries and individual states that JII have higher mortality and similar causes of death as identified by other research.

So this part is definitely focused more on descriptive analysis.

If the data allows, perhaps some inferential statistical models could be estimated and state rankings/comparisons could be made.

### Part 2

[[Numident]] file -> Every individual in the USA with a Social Security number who has died is in this dataset. Unfortunately, they do not have a cause of death in this data.
  
In research, it is hard to determine why someone desisted. Specifically in this case, did someone desist because they died, were re-incarcerated, or *officially* desisted (not formally observed committing another crime -> arrested/convicted).

This part of the project will focus on better describing true rates of official desistance when controlling for death and re-incapacitation spells. We will be using CJARS data to identify at what points in time an individual was re-incarcerated (and if they were).  

Also wish to compare official desistance rates for people released without any conditions (or finished their community supervision) to those under probation/parole.

### My role

My role will to be to look at the datasets, see how possible it is to link the data, and generate descriptive results. My involvement will mostly be on the data side of things. As we move towards publication, I could shift my role more towards that.

Professor Siyu Liu presented to the board of CJARS in June, and people seemed intrigued and interested.

## Logistics

* The start date is fluid. It will likely be after I come back from China and perhaps a little bit before the semester starts. It really is up in the air, though.
  
* Number of work hours -> In the beginning, it will likely be once a week (full day, half a day, 4 - 8 hours) as Professor Siyu Liu and I work together to understand the data. As I become more independent, it may be the case that I work with the data on the project more spread out throughout the week and for longer (10 hours a week).
  
* $15 / hour.
  
* Total funding availability is $5000 (but that includes Siyu Liu's travel). Siyu Liu hopes to get more funding in case funds run out. I will not be doing data work if I cannot be paid for it. If I finish the data work while there are still funds available, I can work with the team on publishing the paper. If I finish the data work and the funds are extinguished, I can still work on the paper, but I should not expect to be paid.
  
* Weekly / bi-weekly meetings.

### Personal use of the data

* Siyu Liu's understanding is that if you want to do something with the data, the Census needs to know about it.
  
* Can I use the data right now for my own personal projects? You need to submit your code ahead of time for it to be admitted into the clean room. You are not allowed to bring any electronic devices into the clean room. The results from those analyses cannot leave the room without Census approval. Any analyses, code, or results not part of the original scope of the project will likely not be allowed in or out.
  
* Within the clean room, I can write code and run analyses, though. I can take notes, plan in my head, generate ideas, and I can see how feasible my project would be/what initial results might look like. I can anticipate what analyses I might run which are currently outside the scope of Siyu Liu's project. Being able to see what is possible gives me a huge leg up over everyone else in terms of writing my proposal. It is one of the main advantages of this GA position.
  
* To be able to publish/share the results of my analysis, I would need to submit my own proposal to the Census with the help of Emily.
  
* The bar for proposals does not seem very high. It seems like it is more of a formality.
  
* Need to confirm all of this with Emily.
