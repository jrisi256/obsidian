## Darrell Steffensmeier's Typed Notes from CRIM512

### Propositions

Most Sociologists are *choice* theorists:

1) Assume behavior is _purposive_ (e.g., is basic Meadian assumption).
   
2) Under threat of force *constraints* and normative orientations, men make *choices*.
   
3) People choose and act differently under different structural arrangements.
	1) [[Hobbes]] -> Left alone they are a danger to each other and the social order. Their impulses must be curbed.
	   
4) Central foundation of a social order is _social control_. I.e., getting others to do what has to be done if the system is to be held together. Gov’t is all about getting people to follow the rules, to conform & be productive citizens.
   
5) Sociology asserts people are moved not only by a calculation of gains and losses others rationally impose on them, but they also are moved to act because they feel that some goals, values, norms, or behaviors are good in themselves whether or not they are directly pleasurable. These elements of action are *non-rational*. There is a _moral normative order_ (e.g., via Parsons).
	1) **Physical/material well being (economic model) vs. respect (appraisal of others) and belonging (sociological model). These are not testable assumptions.**
	2) **Question**: How fruitful the competing assumptions are for analysis and understanding?
	   
6) Economists tend to have hard time dealing with the non-rational or normative.

7) Sociologists assume that people do try to choose among the available options, and they will choose their better alternatives (as they define them). Those individuals are likely better off than they would have had been had they chosen otherwise.

8) **Conclusion** -> All we have to do (as social scientists) is to find out what people want + the influencing power of the factors that affect them, and we can predict what they and the larger system will do.

9) Goode -> “what distinguishes economics and sociology is not the use of some form of rational self-interest. A glance at our propositions and findings will prove that we constantly show how people seek what they want as sensibly as they can” (p. 53).
	1) As Herbert Simon (1978), p. 104) writes: “Almost all human behavior has a large rational component.”
	   
10) Sociologists add to this the importance of social structure (e.g. instrumentality of groups we are part of) and the moral order (normative, wants, ends) as inherent in all social action.
	1) Steffensmeier (1983. 2005): “The availability of concrete opportunities helps explain why offenders gravitate to those activities which are easily available, are within their skills, provide a satisfactory return, and carry the fewest risks” (1983: 1085).
	   
11) Bandura (Samspon/Laub) -> people have agency, and they make choices; Perspective in which individuals are producers of experiences and shapers of events (Bandura = self efficacy).

12) See Shover *choice theory* article in 2010 Cullen/Agnew (4th edition). And Fall 2010 Criminology and Policy journal.  **The attraction -> *choice* and *deterrence* can be applied to white collar crimes and other crimes that criminologists are especially upset about and believe that harsher punishments would deter.**

### Rational Choice theory via Clarke and Cornish (in Cullen/Agnew reader)

[[clarkeModelingOffendersDecisions1985]]

There is much that is thoughtful and helpful in rational choice theorists like Clarke and Cornish so be careful not to throw out the baby with the bath water. E.g., We can see a lot of their thinking in Confessions of a Dying Thief both in the commentaries and narratives. What Clarke & Cornish say is (mostly) consistent with Sutherland, Akers, Merton, etc.

**Clarke (and Cornish) are reductionist –> will boil down everything to *returns* (potential benefits, rewards, costs, and potential losses).**

1) They draw heavily on classical and economic theories (crimes are broadly the result of rational or reasoned choices based on analyses of anticipated costs and benefits) but then muddies this up by bringing in previous learning and experience that, in turn, are heavily influenced by a range of background factors, upbringing, social and demographic characteristics, etc. that are drawn from other theories of crime, most notably, social learning and social bond theories. (The latter is Akers’ argument).

2) Most rational choice theories don’t worry much about *dispositions* or *motivations* but focus on _**situational decision-making.**_  They de-emphasize the *pathological* side of crime.

3) There is strong linkages to *opportunity* and [[Routine activity]] (e.g., Clarke’s “offender search theory”).

4) The major focus is on explaining *crime events*.
   
	1) They distinguish two types of decisions of individuals contemplating crime:
		1) Initial involvement decision –> whether  one is willing to become involved in crime to satisfy their needs.
		2) Criminal event decision –>  If one decides to commit crime, one must decide to commit a particular offense which will be heavily influenced by the immediate situation of the individual.
		3) Seee some of this in economic theory \#3.
		4) See W.I. Thomas *Definition of Situation* handout.
		   
	2) Compare to Lemert's notion of risk taking and process.

	3) Factors that individuals consider may differ dramatically from one type of crime to another. So crime-specific models must be employed –> different models of decision-making are necessary for different types of crime.

	4) Situational crime prevention -> importance of criminal opportunities for influencing the amount, nature, and location of crime. Since all theories of crime are also theories of crime prevention this means that to reduce crime one can take away the _situational_ opportunity to commit crime.
		1) e.g., go after “hot spots” such as areas in transition zone or inner city.

### Choice & Rational Choice & Economic-Choice Frameworks

* Classical Tradition -> Economic (maximum expected utility) model; cost-benefit/returns model, rational choice theory. Cesare Beccaria & Jeremy Bentham.
  
* Expected Utility Maximization -> predominant model of human decision-making since World War II.

* Man as _utility_ maximizer -> very very robustly driven by self-interest especially in monetary terms.

* _Gary Becker’s model_: [[beckerCrimePunishmentEconomic1968]]
  
	* **Key idea** -> People calculate the expected utilities of criminal and noncriminal actions and choose the one with the greatest expected utility. See offenders as making reasoned, informed, and calculated choices in much the same way that intelligent consumers do. Then, they calculate the costs/benefits of the current penal policies as well as their actions. What is _**less costly**_ _**approach, not what is most human.**_
	  
	* Argues the number of crimes committed by a person is a function of four/five factors:
		1) Probability of conviction (punishment).
		2) Nature and severity of the punishment.
		3) Income available to the actor from alternative legal and illegal activities.
		4) Frequency of nuisance arrests (these are costs in time, expense, etc).
		5) Actor’s willingness to commit an illegal act (preferences, tastes) _added later_.
			1) Can include here “tastes” like morality/shame, comfort, and prestige.
			2) Time as a key variable for some economists (Erhlich).

	* But *tastes* and process of balancing rewards against risks can vary considerably across peoples and is heavily influenced by social structure, situational factors, and one’s life history.
		- Returns & costs.
		- Risk averse vs. risk takers.
		- Operationalization of variables and their significance for crime/conformity is often very different from sociologists. E.g., *Marital status* is correlated with crime –> economists argue married people have less time for crime than single people vs. sociologists argue that marital status relates to degree of social integration & bonds with conventional society.
		  
	- Becker’s focus is on crime’s monetary returns and the financial costs associated with state sanctions (i.e., the monetary equivalent of punishment). Becker = market model & can monetize non-market variables.

	- Becker recognizes certainty of punishment is more effective than severity -> knows increasing police resources will increase certainty more so than increasing resources for incarceration. Then concludes that increasing incarceration is much less costly than increasing policing. Next concludes that, on balance, costs from increasing policing to increasing certainty are greater than costs to increasing incarceration for greater severity. So, comes in favor of increasing incarceration -> though it seems less humane of the two approaches.

	- Following Becker, there is widespread tendency to focus on a small set of costs and benefits. Key prediction of economic approach is that, “Crime is reduced by reducing the monetary gains to crime or by increasing the probability/certainty or severity of \[state] punishment.” (see Schmidt & Witte 1984:154; Levitt & Lockner 2001:335).

	- A fair number of sociologists lean toward or are *rational choice* theorists (e.g. Coleman).

	- Sociologists have contributed to the economic approach to crime’s costs by proposing a more inclusive approach to crime’s costs or liabilities including: stigma, rejection, guilt, shame, weakening of bonds and norms, reputation losses, etc. Can be an almost unlimited listing of costs and benefits or returns (e.g., rewards of crime, satisfying needs, meeting identities).

	- Economists, especially when influenced by sociologists and some psychologists, may recognize potential costs and benefits that are not monetary (e.g., opportunity costs, sunk costs), but their decision making models typically assign monetary values to these.  Can be risk adverse versus risk seekers.

### Cognitive Social Psychology, Behavioral Economics, and Prospect Theory

* What is rational? Is man a rational decision maker? What is a rational actor?
	* Social desirability -> gender = women offenders are *rational* and have choice but then say *no choice*.
	* Sutherland and Lombroso are alike in that both assume man is not a rational actor (Anthony Walsh).
	  
* Examines *bias* in decision-making.
  
* Lowenstein –> role of emotions, sexual arousal, visceral needs, drugs, alcohol, anger.
  
* Prospect theory -> Thaler & Kahneman are the biggies.
  
* Most people think they are rational decision makers and follow a rational-decision template, **but in reality are not.** See Daniel Kahneman-> _Thinking, Fast and Slow._
  
* Dual Systems -> emotion and reason in Aristotle.
  
* Atomistic versus embedded or contextual views of choice.
	* Situated choice (Sampson & Laub).
	  
* Reductionist as in Cornish & Clarke –> they say if look back far enough and dig deeply enough, will find reasoning.
	* See critique by G. Hodges.

### Other theories of choice or rational choice

1) J. Bentham (deterrence theory) –> ratio of positive to negative emotions is the basis of choice.
2) William Goode represents traditional sociological view.
3) Prospect Theory via Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky (e.g. two systems of cognitive processing; more adverse to losses than choose for gains).
4) Akers & Bandura (social learning theory).
5) Clarke, Paternoster, and Shover.
6) Lemert-Cottrell with Steffensmeier (and Schwartz & Ulmer).

#### Meaning of Choice

* Steffensmeier & Schwartz -> recent chapter on gender & crime.
	* Draws heavily from Lemert & Cottrell and Goode.
	* Choice is _reasoned action as based on a mixture of what is thinkable and doable_.
	* “... women and men exercise some measure of agency in the choices they make which contributes to individual-level differences in outcomes.”

* “Choice has to do with evaluating actions or options for satisfying values or desirable ends or _claims_, such as happiness/fulfillment, improved economic well-being or social status, physical or material security, drive for excitement or _belonging/sustaining a relationship_ (Lemert). Though values or ends _or claims_ exist within some hierarchy, the opportunity for an individual to exercise unfettered choice is unrealistic because persons typically must seek their ends in a world of limited means and through the instrumentality of an organized group.  Choices are structured by not only internal limits (e.g., aspirations, moral concerns, identities) but also by external limits (e.g., physical and material means) that together shape thinkable courses of actions (i.e., what I think or see as likely or possible versus unlikely or impossible). People also take into account whether their choices produced the expected results as well as consequences of prior choices. Objective conditions are relevant in making judgments about possible courses of action, including the decision to engage in crime or deviance. The objective conditions pertain not only to external social factors (e.g., time, energy, requisite skill, access to suitable co-offenders) but also to physical and biological facts (e.g., sexuality, physicality). Consequently, a give and take occurs in which individuals sacrifice some values or ends _\[or claims]_ in order to satisfy others.”

* "Gender powerfully shapes, but does not determine, those courses of action that people see as possible or rewarding. Theoretical frameworks devised for the study of crime/deviance, and of female deviance specifically, ought to reveal how people take both subjective and objective conditions into account for making judgments about deviance by themselves and others. This pertains not only to external social facts but also to physical and biological facts. The framework we present next seeks to do that.”

* Steffensmeier (1983. 2005) -> “The availability of concrete opportunities helps explain why offenders gravitate to those activities which are easily available, are within their skills, provide a satisfactory return, and carry the fewest risks” (1983: 1085).

* Models of Man and Conception of Choice Are Important:
	* Man as amoral, ugly, and self-interested.
	* Man as moral and a mix of prosocial and antisocial tendencies.
	* Shapes the way people and society define acceptable behavior and what behaviors they will tolerate -> policies, elected officials, etc.
		* Greed is good vs. sharing and helping is good.
		* See Bonger about the effects of capitalism and what man does to fellow man.
	* Shapes way we as scholars study and interpret the world we live in and social phenomena we study.
