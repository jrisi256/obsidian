### Criminal Capital Essay, 2020 December 19

#### Early development of criminal capital and opportunity

Opportunity was recognized early on in Criminology as being an important component in the commission of a crime. Adolphe Quetelet, writing in the early 1800’s, recognized that for a crime to occur motive and opportunity are necessary. The propensity for an individual to commit a crime is linked to their: morality (internal limits), temptations they’re exposed to (external limits), and the ease with which they could commit a crime (partly external, partly internal). Patrick Colquhoun, also writing in the early 1800’s, recognized some environments are more criminogenic than. Specifically Colquhoun pointed to crime opportunities as being promoted by the expansion of noncriminal activities. Illegal activities feed upon legal activities. The economic and social structure of a society along with the patterns of social activity will subsequently play a large role in determining location, type, and quantity of crime/illegal activities. It was thus established early on in Criminology there were two main components to opportunity: internal factors (what we call limits) and external limits. How subjectively willing are you to commit crime? How objectively possible is it for crime to be committed by you?

#### External limits - [[cohenSocialChangeCrime1979]]

The focus on external limits and how one’s built environment structures their opportunities for committing crime has become a much more active area of research as of late. In particular, the work of Cohen & Felson has been identified as the originating source for this line of research. Their theory labelled as _Routine Activities Theory_ has a unique starting point which is that individual or group inclination to commit crime is given or held constant. They instead highlight the changing spatio-temporal organization of social activities as a possible explanation for the relative increase or decrease in crime in a specific area. They claim when there is an increasing convergence in time and space of _likely offenders_, _suitable targets_, and _absence of capable guardians_ this will lead to an increase in crime. So even if the proportion of motivated offenders and suitable targets were to remain the same, changes in either of those groups’ routine activities which led to them being in the same places at the same time would create more opportunities for crime to occur.

#### Internal Limits

Other research and theorizing has focused more on what Cohen & Felson take as a given or constant, namely the individual or group inclination to commit crime. What shapes somebody’s internal limits as to how subjectively permissible it is to commit crime? Sutherland addresses this issue in the context of his differential association theory and establishes what he calls the _person-situation complex_. The person-situation complex is composed of three main parts: an excess of learned definitions favorable to crime, the person has the requisite skills to carry out the crime, the person has the objective opportunity to carry out the crime. For Sutherland, the objective or external opportunities conducive to crime were necessary but not sufficient for crime to occur meaning an objective opportunity assessed as not conducive to crime may still result in crime happening. Sutherland argues this is because individuals define situations for themselves based on their learned definitions. An opportunity being conceived of as objectively conducive to crime will vary from person to person.

Cloward & Ohlin ([[clowardIllegitimateMeansAnomie1959]]) expanded upon Sutherland’s work (and Merton’s work) by invoking the idea of _illegitimate opportunity structures_. Similar to how Merton explained that legitimate opportunities were unevenly distributed across society, Cloward & Ohlin argue illegitimate opportunities are also unevenly distributed. Stated more plainly, if somebody decides to engage in deviant or criminal activities, their ability to do so is going to be different based upon who they are. People’s ability to engage in illegitimate activity (as well as legitimate activity for that matter) is based on _learning structures_ and _opportunity structures_. Learning structures are opportunities where one learns how to commit illegitimate acts and also where one learns definitions favorable to crime (in a nod to Sutherland). It also involves learning to see opportunities for crime where others unlearned in crime wouldn’t see such an opportunity. Opportunity structures are opportunities to employ what one has learned. Just as one can go to business school and never get the chance to practice it because they don’t get hired, one can learn to be a thief but not have the opportunity to practice it. As mentioned earlier these learning and opportunity structures are unevenly distributed throughout society. As a result, one’s ability to access these illegitimate opportunities is going to be structured by their identity e.g. their social class, their race, their sex, their age, their physical prowess.

The interactionist [[labeling theory]] also has its own treatment of criminal opportunity. Criminal actions are delimited by internal and external limits. Actors have agency which is constrained by the specific situation as well as the specific structure of society they’re acting in. The internal and external limits are in interplay with each other though in a constantly unfolding dialectical process. The objective ability to engage in an act can affect one’s willingness to do so, and then vice versa one’s willingness can cause one to seek out opportunities. Objective ability includes things like knowledge, skills, tools, and one’s criminal contact network for finding out about potential crime opportunities, victims, and partners, and these things will affect your subjective willingness to commit crimes just as your subjective willingness to commit crime led the individual to building out their objective ability. As mentioned earlier with Cloward & Ohlin, one’s ability to select into these networks and opportunities are going to be delimited by one’s identity and status in society.

#### Actor-Centered Approach to Criminal Opportunity & Criminal Capital

The Steffensmeier extension/revision ([[steffensmeierTakingCriminalOpportunity2015]]), broadly speaking, contends criminologists must consider opportunity more broadly, and consider it its own concept worthy of theoretical consideration. The theory contends that while there are objective conditions conducive to crime, this ignores how people construct their own opportunities. Motivated offenders can create their own opportunities, and more _perceived_ opportunities for crime can increase one’s motivation to commit crime.

A person can increase their opportunities for committing crime just as a person can increase their opportunities for doing legitimate things like conducting business. They create an _opportunity portfolio_ which is the collection of their physical, social, and cultural capital for executing crime. It represents one’s ability to mobilize resources and contacts for committing a crime, and it also represents one’s ability to recognize and exploit opportunities for crime (ties back to the original thesis which states a person interactively shapes their opportunities).

One builds their criminal capital or opportunity portfolio through learning and performance opportunities. In other words, one must have the motivation and willingness to take advantage of an opportunity to commit crime, and one must have learned the requisite knowledge and skills to do so.

Knowledge can be _civil_ (knowledge most people have which can be used for criminal ends e.g. knowing the layout of a store), _preparatory_ (familiarity with orientations and techniques of crime acquired by being embedded in criminal groups), and _technical_ (involves mechanical skills like breaking a safe, interpersonal skills like knowing whom to trust and work with, and perceptual skills like knowing who would make an easy target).

Performance opportunities not only involve perceiving when an opportunity for crime is present but also having access to those places and targets in the first place. This will involve: having access to a crime network to have people to commit crimes with and to learn about opportunities for crime, having access to the necessary tools and hardware to complete a job, and being in a place where there are suitable targets for the type of crime you’re looking to commit (e.g. burglary, conning, check fraud).

The last important point to mention is crime opportunity portfolios are going to vary based on traits of the individual such as their age, gender, race/ethnicity, and social class, and it will also vary across time and space (meaning certain areas during certain time periods will be more or less amenable to certain types of crime). As for the traits of the individual, there is much empirical evidence to support the claim that crime is racially and gender biased. African-Americans and women have a much harder time accessing opportunity structures of crime and accessing learning structures of crime.

In particular for women, there are many factors working against them which prohibit them for becoming successful criminals in the same way men can be successful. For starters, male criminals viewed women as not having the requisite traits necessary for being a good criminal e.g. they were physically weak/not intimidating, untrustworthy (easier for the cops to break), emotionally unstable, not as courageous/likely to flee or crack under pressure. Since women were viewed as low-status criminals, men trying to climb the ranks would ensure never to be seen with women too often as it would hurt their status. In the hierarchy of criminal organizations, women, as a result, were never able to climb the ladder of success because they’re denied opportunities to learn, and they’re denied opportunities to build their capital, networks, and contacts by associating with criminals. This discrimination against women not only occurs in blue-collar crime settings but also in white-collar crime settings.

#### Confessions of a Dying Thief As A Motivating Example

Confessions of a Dying Thief and in particular the _protagonist_ of the narrative elements, Sam Goodman, serves as an illustrative example of the ideas expressed above concerning criminal capital and how this capital serves as a means of making crime both objectively possible and subjectively acceptable. From an early age, the anti-criminal messages were weakly organized in Sam’s life, even absent really. Sam didn’t have a particularly loving family unit, and he didn’t attend high school. As a result, he didn’t establish many bonds to contemporary society. At around age 15 he had an uncle who took him to a brothel, and he also began to turn his _entrepreneuring spirit_ into illegal side hustles (robbing gas stations, pimping out girls). This describes the person-situation complex Sutherland was describing. Sam hadn’t learned many anti-criminal messages growing up, and as a result he was subjectively open to the possibility of crime whenever the opportunity presented itself. Additionally one can see how even at this early age without much capital Sam had already begun constructing his own criminal opportunities (pimping out girls) where somebody else who had learned more anti-criminal messages wouldn’t see this as a criminal opportunity.

Eventually Sam’s early crimes landed him in county jail and eventually in state prison. Prison afforded Sam with _learning_ _structures_ on how to become a professional thief but also a professional fence (somebody who sells stolen goods). Things he learned included: how to size people up (ease of victimization), how to assess a home or business for burglary or how to case a property (locks, cameras, security guard routines), how to con somebody, how to get away from a crime scene with the stolen goods, and how to sell the stolen goods. It made Sam realize crime could be a business. Like any successful businessman, a criminal needs to develop their network. Sam needed a way to learn about opportunities for burglary. He needed to have a crew or partners available to pull off the crime with him. He also needed a network of fences he could sell the stolen goods too. This was arguably one of the most important aspects of the job because simply being able to steal things wasn’t useful in and of itself unless those goods could be sold for money.

This knowledge and network Sam developed while in prison constituted his criminal capital which he was building. It initially stemmed out of rather naive desire or interest in committing crime. It may not even be an interest exactly so much as the fact that Sam wasn’t _against_ the idea of committing a crime. Subsequent contact with the criminal underworld enhanced Sam’s ability to commit crimes, and this led to an increased desire on his part to execute crimes. Just like any skill or activity one is learning, one wishes to engage in opportunities to put those newly used skills to work. It’s a self-affirming process. One constructs their identity around the activity and one engages in self-validating actions which confirm one is good at those activities.

Certain aspects of Sam’s identity also made it easier for him to learn about crime but also to be successful in it and accrue capital. The most important facet may very well have been Sam’s sex. Sam acknowledges as much that there is discrimination against women in the criminal underworld. They’re stereotyped as unreliable, emotional, not strong enough, and not intimidating enough. As a result, women are blocked from advancement in the criminal underworld. They aren’t able to participate in crime as much, they aren’t able to learn as much, they aren’t able to build out a network. In other words, they cannot build out their criminal capital. Another important aspect of Sam’s identity which actually in some ways led to a desistance from crime was his age. As Sam got older, he found his physical capital was in decline, and he couldn’t keep up as much in the physically active parts of crime. He also had more stakes or shall we say _legitimate capital_. He found he had more to lose now as a result of his criminal activities, and he didn’t want to lose these new forms of capital. This meant a gradual letting go of some forms of his _criminal capital_. He had to let go of some of his thieving skills and know-how. Sam’s social class also contributed greatly to his ability to learn crime. Legitimate opportunities were rare in his community because there was a lack of legitimate capital in the area. As a result, there were more opportunities for people to learn illegitimate means for securing their wants and goals. This process is also interactive because as individuals engage in these activities more their goals, aspirations, and identity change to match the activities they are doing. Sam Goodman did as much. He constructed his identity around the fact he was a good thief and a good fence.

#### Future Research

The concepts of opportunity and criminal capital have been enormously illuminating in terms of helping sociologists and criminologists better understand the conditions which lead people to crime. Of course, there are always ways to expand the field’s understanding and advance these concepts. Much work has been done examining how race, sex, and social class structure opportunities. It would be interesting to see how other aspects of identity shape opportunities and ability to form capital (or in some case inhibit it). For example, how does one’s gender expression and sexual orientation affect one’s crime opportunities if at all? Does religious identity affect one’s criminal learning opportunities? It may be the case these identities shape the _types of crime_ one is able to learn about and commit.

Another interesting line of research would be into white-collar crime. Some work has already been done in this regard concerning how women are usually not involved in white-collar crime due to discrimination. However other lines of inquiry could be pursued concerning why certain individuals pursue white-collar crime while others don’t even as they work at the same firm. What aspects of their identity allow them to see white-collar crime as subjectively permissible and objectively possible? What are the sources of pro-criminal messages in their lives?

#### Highlight guts or key ideas of Cloward (with Ohlin) Opportunity Theory

Cloward begins by stating Merton believed the distribution of adaptations (e.g. retreatists, innovators, conformists) in a particular society is the result of two things. The first is the extent to which the individual feels pressure (imposed by the social structure in regards to achieving success-goals and how blocked off from legitimate opportunity they are), and the second is how internalized are the prohibitions against the use of illegitimate means to achieve success-goals (i.e. values).

From this starting point, Cloward says a third variable needs to be introduced which is the differential in availability of illegitimate means. Cloward makes the point that not all unsatisfied or anomic individuals are going to have an equal opportunity to satisfy themselves in illegitimate ways similar to how legitimate means are also unevenly spread throughout society. Stated more plainly, if somebody decides to engage in deviant or criminal activities, their ability to do so is going to be different based upon who they are.

Cloward goes on to state he means two things by _means_ (both legitimate and illegitimate). The first structure implied by means are _learning structures_. One must first learn how to commit illegitimate (or legitimate) acts. The second structure implied by means are _opportunity structures_. This represents how often one has the opportunity to employ what one has learned (either in legitimate or illegitimate settings). Just as one can go to business school and never get the chance to practice it because they don’t get hired, one can learn to be a thief but not have the opportunity to practice it.

Cloward concludes by stating his theory bridges the gap between Sutherland’s theories which emphasize learning structures and Merton’s theories which emphasize access to legitimate opportunities while expanding upon Merton by stressing access to illegitimate opportunities. Cloward’s expansion also helps to make sense of Shaw and McKay’s social disorganization theory where it’s clarified that slums aren’t actually socially disorganized, but they are organized in such a way so as to promote learning structures and opportunity structures conducive to crime and deviance, i.e. there is greater access to illegitimate means. While not exploring this point further, Cloward emphasizes access to illegitimate means will not only be determined by place but also on other aspects of one’s social identity (e.g. social class, race/ethnicity, and gender).

#### Highlight guts or key ideas of Felson/Cohen Routine Activities Theory

Felson and Cohen start with a paradox that urban crime rates have been increasing (in the 1960’s and 1970’s) despite the improvement in structural conditions which were thought to produce crime. So rather than examining why individuals or groups are inclined to commit crime (they take it as a given), they point to the changing spatio-temporal organization of social activities as a possible explanation for the increase in crime. Specifically, they claim there has been an increasing convergence in time and space of _likely offenders_, _suitable targets_, and _absence of capable guardians_. So even if the proportion of motivated offenders and suitable targets were to remain the same and have remained the same, changes in either of their routine activities which led to them being in the same places at the same time would create more opportunities for crime to occur. This is what they claim has been happening.

They point to a few trends to help explain this convergence. First, the increase in automobile ownership and also the increase in production, distribution, and consumption of expensive yet highly movable electronic appliances has led to an increase in the number of goods which can be easily stolen. Second, there’s been an increasing number of people whose social and work lives are situated away from their home meaning there is more opportunity now to burgle people’s homes. Third, the increase of women in the workforce has meant there are economically suitable targets to steal from but also more single-adult households to steal from. A number of other empirical implications from their follows as well: people are much more likely to be victimized away from home when they’re alone, there are higher rates of burglary which happen during the daytime when people are away from their home, those who are handicapped are more likely to be victimized (less able to protect themselves/less presence of guardians).

#### Highlight guts or key ideas of Steffensmeier extension/revision (plus gender)

The Steffensmeier extension/revision, broadly speaking, contends criminologists have considered opportunity too narrowly. While there certainly may be objective conditions conducive to crime (which Sutherland briefly mentions but never integrates fully into his learning theories), this ignores how people construct their own opportunities. Motivated offenders can create their own opportunities, and more _perceived_ opportunities for crime can increase one’s motivation to commit crime.

A person can increase their opportunities for committing crime just as a person can increase their opportunities for doing legitimate things like conducting business. They create an _opportunity portfolio_ which is the collection of their physical, social, and cultural capital for executing crime. It represents one’s ability to mobilize resources and contacts for committing a crime, and it also represents one’s ability to recognize and exploit opportunities for crime (ties back to the original thesis which states a person interactively shapes their opportunities).

One builds their criminal capital or opportunity portfolio through learning and performance opportunities. In other words, one must have the motivation and willingness to take advantage of an opportunity to commit crime, and one must have learned the requisite knowledge and skills to do so.

Knowledge can be _civil_ (knowledge most people have which can be used for criminal ends e.g. knowing the layout of a store), _preparatory_ (familiarity with orientations and techniques of crime acquired by being embedded in criminal groups), and _technical_ (involves mechanical skills like breaking a safe, interpersonal skills like knowing whom to trust and work with, and perceptual skills like knowing who would make an easy target).

Performance opportunities not only involve perceiving when an opportunity for crime is present but also having access to those places and targets in the first place. This will involve: having access to a crime network to have people to commit crimes with and to learn about opportunities for crime, having access to the necessary tools and hardware to complete a job, and being in a place where there are suitable targets for the type of crime you’re looking to commit (e.g. burglary, conning, check fraud).

The last important point to mention is crime opportunity portfolios are going to vary based on traits of the individual such as their age, gender, race/ethnicity, and social class, and it will also vary across time and space (meaning certain areas during certain time periods will be more or less amenable to certain types of crime).

In the hierarchy of criminal organizations, women, as a result, were never able to climb the ladder of success because they’re denied opportunities to learn, and they’re denied opportunities to build their capital, networks, and contacts by associating with criminals. This discrimination against women not only occurs in blue-collar crime settings but also in white-collar crime settings.
