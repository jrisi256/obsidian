## Workflow in the Federal Data Research Center

* When a project is first starting out, you are put into an empty project space. The data is provided to you in the form of SAS extracts. The recommendation is to figure out what rows/columns you need from the data -> convert it into a data format that you can work with -> transfer it to your project area.
  
* I cannot transfer data from Siyu's project space to my project space, but I can transfer my code.
  
* If we have code that we write outside of the research center, we can email it to Emily who can put it into our project area.
  
* We are also allowed to take code out of the research center.
  
* I can even work on my own ideas and project using my code while in the research center.

* It is fairly easy and common to request statistical packages for R and Python.
  
* I have wide leeway methodologically speaking to conduct whatever analyses I see fit so long as it generally fits the original scope of the project.
  
* I have also have some freedom when it comes to exploring different outcomes so long as it is related to the originally approved project. For example, if the original project talked about estimating the causal impact of incarceration on employment, it would be fine to look at: earnings, self-employment, IRS tax return data (assuming I had access), attachment to labor force, characteristics of where they worked, etc. It would not be fine to look at fertility, childhood academic achievement, etc.
  
* Generally speaking, you will be limited to the data you request in your project proposal.

* Bringing in publicly available data is also pretty easy and straightforward. Publicly available data not originally listed in your proposal is also fairly easy and straightforward to bring into the research data center.

### Disclosure Review

* While the Census is pretty loose around code, they are much more strict around releasing results.
  
* Results allowed out of the data center must be related to the research goals and research scope of the project. As a result, I would not be able to take out my own results.
  
* Handwritten notes are allowed, but they must stay in the lab.
  
* I would most likely not be able to take out information related to the structure of the data or column headers. I would not be able to generate synthetic data or anything like that, either.
  
* I also cannot talk about project results, either. I can only discuss project results with people listed on the application.

## To-dos for my proposal

1. Seriously consider whether to include the [[LEHD]] data in the scope of my project because it would add a great deal of complexity to my project.
	1. If I do wind up considering to include the LEHD data, I should cross-reference which states have [[CJARS]] coverage with which states have LEHD coverage.
	   
2. When the project proposal is finished, double-check with Emily that I am requesting all necessary [[PIK]] files (e.g., for linking CJARS individuals to their addresses).
   
3. The last major piece of the puzzle that I need to include in my proposal is how would this benefit the Census:
	1. Look through the proposal guidelines for the 13 commonly accepted criteria the Census looks for in terms of how the research will benefit them.
	2. Pick 2 to 3 criterion.

4. **Extra project idea** -> How does the focal participant's involvement in the criminal justice system affect their children's involvement in the criminal justice system? Could be achieved using only CJARS data.
	1. If I wanted to get data on their educational attainment or household status, that would require [[ACS]] or other socio-demographic Census products. This could, potentially, really limit the scope of the project given how small some of the matches might be.
	2. Emily said this would likely be as complicated as the LEHD so I may just let this go for now.
 
5. The earliest I would have access to the data is Spring 2024.
