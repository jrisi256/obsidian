As we are approaching [[Port Calle]], there appears to be quite the commotion. People are urgently and quickly trying to leave town. People do not appear to be hysterical, and there is no obvious destruction or harm being caused. A half-elf couple point to the sky where a giant orange flame is burning over the town.

[[Fabian]] perceives an ancient drow symbol in the flame from his book [[The Creation of the Sacred Flame and Applications]], the letter S. As we look at the flame, it appears to be growing.

We enter Port Calle, and the flame is huge at this point. It appears to be descending closer and closer to the town, and it is aimed for the center of town. People are beginning to panic and enter into mass hysteria. The guards are trying to keep order as best they can to prevent a mass panic from breaking out.

In the distance about 100 feet away, we see Sarkus. As we make a beeline for him, he sees us coming towards him which breaks his concentration. He then picks up the book he was using and runs away into the woods. We eventually catch up to him and engage in combat. After a sustained assault, he does manage to escape.

As we retrace our steps and head back to Port Calle, we see a giant flaming monstrosity heading towards town.
