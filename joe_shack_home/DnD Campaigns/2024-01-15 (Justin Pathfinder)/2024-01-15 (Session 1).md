We start in the town of [[Dachad]].

* [[Vanima Auma]]
* [[Voss Whisperwind]]
* [[Alaitha Dawnshadow]]
* [[Mortizal]]

As we all fortuitously meet in the charred ruins of Voss's village, we experience a vision from [[Hildegaard]] compelling us all to work together in her name and exact revenge. She compels us to kill. We find the trail of [[the High Sylvan Legions]] (which was the group who massacred the village) which goes North. We engage in a light skirmish with a rear guard High Elf magically controlling some Frog-people.
