For ~320 years, the [[Echtgrop]] (dark elves) Empire dominated the continent of [[Keufecht]].
Their rule was fierce, but tolerable to the assorted baronies and kingdoms underneath them. They kept control of this great empire through technological dominance inherited from caches of ancient elf technology that only opened to their magicks.

Flying barges, crystalline swords, and autonomous battle constructs kept the other races in line, and a massive tunnel network snaked underneath the eastern lands which protected their trade and logistics.

100 years ago, a massive horde of draconic sailing ships, and their dragon masters, arrived in the capital of the Echtgrop lands, and through intimidation and skullduggery, a dual monarchy was formed between the crown prince of the Echtgrop and the leader of the war-worn dragons. At first, nothing much changed for the citizenry of the Echtgrop's lands, but soon the dragon's need for realms of their own and their innate greed led them to usurp the delicate balance of power of Keufecht. 

A great war began, with the formerly pacified lands of the western half of the continent rising in open rebellion. A team of the greatest tacticians, artificers, and mages the [[Human Baronies of the Mionno Alliance]], [[the Dwarven Mountainholds]], and [[the High Sylvan Legions]] turned on their draconic and Drow masters. Unleashing great anti-magic war machines, they hunted the dragons to extinction, and overthrew the drow empire. Many of the technologies of the old empire were demolished, and the lands were ravaged by war.

During the fighting, a unifier of the orcs, [[Warchief Gakka Draz]] saw the massive armies marching through the savannas and salt flats of the region known to them as [[Gurak]], and rallied the orcs to a unified force. Eventually, he managed to convince both the Echtgrop Empire and the Mionno Alliance to recognize his claim to the arid deserts of Gurak, and he established the first orcish kingdom, [[Duth Gurak]].

After the war, the humans took control of the former Echtgrop lands as tributary states, and committed a horrific purge of anyone they felt would harbor resentment. 40% of the female population, and a staggering 86% of the male population of Drow were executed. The holy order of knights, [[the Rittket]], were wiped out seemingly to a man, sparing a few of their squires and artificers.

~30 years ago, the Sylvan Legion began a war against [[the Logcac]], a massive druidic weirwood made up of many fey and monstrous races living in harmony with nature. An insurgency, spearheaded by the [[Wyr Sylvan]] (wood elves), has been fighting the encroaching legions for those three decades. The war has resulted in a stalemate the last 5 years, with the lines moving little. 

The Legion has committed one of their most accomplished warrior-generals, [[Legatus Ionus Horinus]], to solve the issue of stalemate through butchery and brutality. Human slavers are given free reign to privateer throughout the land, and many of the people not killed in these raids are forced to fight to the death in the great gladiator slave pits of the western [[Legios]].

One year before the start of the campaign, a burgeoning collection of orcish minor nobles and military officials from Duth Gurak have called for a return to tradition, and at the height of their military and political power, stormed the capital of the Mionno Alliance, slaughtering almost all people within the city. The king and queen were murdered, and the princess Alezandra was made a trophy mistress of the Orcish Warlord [[Zug Dathrik]].

In response, a General from the neighboring barony of [[Narseo]] called upon all alliances and pacts he could muster, and led a massive army to retake the capital. Zug Dathrik was slain, and the general married the princess, now known as [[Blood Queen Alezandra]]. The greater human world has declared there to be a war of genocide, to wipe the troublesome orcs from the map.

The orcish military left over, stripped of much of its might by the warlord's recruitment and calls to war, began recruiting from the myriad of refugees inhabiting Duth Gurak due to its neutral status in the great war, many being Kobolds, Lizard-people, Snake-people, and a few Drow. A young Drow, a former squire of the Rittket Order, [[Guntehr Vesemeyer]], rallied his own forces, recruiting from the ravaged front line towns in the conflict, and has begun a counter offensive, using his access to the might of the former Sylvan god of life and fertility, [[Hildegaard]], to unlock more caches of the Ancient Sylvan, and brings the fight to the human lands.

Rumors of internal conflict within the Mountain Homes, and the human kingdoms focused on the eradication of the Orcish races (Goblins, Orcs, Ogres, and Hobgoblins), have meant that many of the non-slaver allies of the Sylvan Legion have called their forces back, giving an opportunity for the people of Logcac to rise up against their oppressors in the face of this instability and confusion.
