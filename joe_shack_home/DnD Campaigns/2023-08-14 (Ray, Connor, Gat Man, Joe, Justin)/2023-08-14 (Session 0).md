7 nations in the land of [[Grasmere]].

* Written history does not extend further back than 200 years.
* There are beings who exist (because they live so long) who know what has happened before written history.
* It is a cause of concern for some (dire concern for some), but for most people in everyday dealings it is not really a matter of concern.
* Land of relative peace.
* Mountains in the north, forests in the center, wetlands to the south west, swamp and the under dark in the south east.

**7 nations**
* [[Orith]] -> Human home.
* [[Gomal]] -> Dwarven home
* [[Grovia]] -> Elven home.
* [[Zeada]] -> The halfing home
* [[Akhris]] -> The dark place.
* [[Alero]] -> The dragon home.
* [[Lannark]] -> The ever home.

**Important cities**
* [[Port Calle]] -> Moderately sized port.
* [[Aerith Academy]] -> Center of Knowledge in Lanark.
* Between the two -> [[Ufer]]. Small town. Stopping point between the two cities. Half-day's ride between the two. We found ourselves arriving into town late one night/obtaining lodging late and having to spend the night in the basement in the [[Dew Drop Inn]]. The campaign begins the following morning.
	* The road East from Ufer leads to Aerith Academy and eventually Grovia through a forest that has not seen light in years, perhaps ever.
	* Road North leads to Alero.
	* Road South leads to Akhris.
