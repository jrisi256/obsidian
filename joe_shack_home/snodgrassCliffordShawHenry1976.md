## My notes

### Background

* [[Shaw and McKay]] had very similar upbringings. Farm boys with [[Christian]] backgrounds. McKay was the quiet statistician while Shaw was the activist who related to delinquents to get their life stories (very good at getting people to open up) and organized to create community reform movements.
* Shaw wanted to be a minister, but after attending seminary, he was exposed to liberal ideas and became disillusioned with religion and saw it as a barrier to humanity.
* “Many of the social pathologists were fathered by the rural, protestant ministry.” #quote 
* Interesting little nugget about McKay and his desire to not indict American society over its treatment of African-Americans.
* Quote from [[Saul Alinksy]] who constantly butted heads with Shaw and eventually quit the [[Chicago Area Project]], “... took a job with the Institute for Juvenile Research, one of those outfits that were always studying the causes of juvenile delinquency, making surveys of all the kids in cold water tenements, with rats nibbling their toes and nothing to eat, and then discovering the solution: camping trips and some shit they called character building.” #quote 
* On Shaw, “... was a field worker who had much less contact with the common people… he really wants to help those who are poor… his method is any method that’ll work… discovers the influential people and uses them, no matter what. Politicians, gamblers, priests, capitalists.” Within the system politico-missionary, pragmatic political management. Saw no incompatibility in pragmatism serving idealism. #quote 
* “... an apostle of community organisation as a way of saving an American city from its own capacity for generating physical deterioration and social disorganization.” Create a community reform movement based ostensibly on science but with the zeal of religion. #quote 

  ### Theory
  
* “Most striking aspect of Shaw and McKay’s interpretation is the absence of attempts to link business and industrial invasion with the causes of delinquency. The interpretation stayed at the communal level and turned inward to find the causes of delinquency in internal conditions...” #quote 
* “...could have turned outward to show political, economic, and historical forces at work… interpretation left business and industry immune from analysis and responsibility in the causes of delinquency.” #quote 
* Kind of remarkable given that Shaw and McKay observe, “Owners of land and property in the interstitial area retained ownership over the land knowing its value would increase as wealthy businesses would buy it to expand. Refrained in investing and maintaining the stock of residential housing as a result because it’d eventually be demolished once it was sold. Thus the value of land was high even if residential property rents were low, creating slums.” Yet they say nothing of this process, viewing it somehow as natural, part of the ecological metabolism and organic development of cities. #quote

  ### Policy
  
  * Chicago Area Project (CAP) was the instantiation of Shaw and McKay’s work into policy. CAP stressed the importance of maintaining the autonomy of the community and to avoid the imposition of Anglo-Saxon middle class standards. Aim was to stimulate community organization without engineering or controlling it. Fieldworkers were to be catalysts and leadership was to come from the residents.
  * Long extended passage by Shaw about his own upbringing (small, tight-knit community) informed his organizing. They weren’t particularly wealthy (maybe even poor), but the community was there for each other. “The model for cities for Shaw was the turn of the century Indiana farm town.” Kind of a very anti-city bias. #quote 
  * “Points of contact and organization around economic, political, and social matters were absent. Specific activities of CAP were the same as those conducted by boys’ clubs.” Shaw believed any internal aim and organizing around that aim would do so long as the residents came together communally to solve it and recreate the bonds of [[Social control theory|social control]]. #quote 
  * Shaw was not stupid. He knew of the economic and political realities. He even writes he doesn’t know how helpful his efforts can be without correcting these broader trends. So it’s surprising, he never dealt with them nor did he turn CAP into a political organization.
  * “... CAP committees are adept at solving local problems but, despite their willingness, are unable to deal with wider social issues… cannot halt urbanization or fight against it… thus can mainly be viewed as stop-gap solutions.” #quote

  ### Limitations of theory and practice

* Good metaphor, “Shaw attempted to prop up and repair the community from the inside while its walls were progressively wrecked from the outside.” CAP was too tied to industry to combat it. Financed by business and board of directors were made up of businessmen. #quote 
* “... expansion and prosperity of industry took precedence over preservation of community.” Snodgrass is very critical, “... unwittingly contributed to the decline of community by not fighting the forces that would destroy it… while searching for community, ignored what they knew full well would destroy it.” #quote 
* Wow, “CAP was a disciplinary force designed to socialize behavior and to achieve an accommodation of slum residents to conventional order and American society.” #quote
