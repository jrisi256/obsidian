## Development of theory

### Overview

* Shaw and McKay found that the racial/ethnic composition of neighborhoods with relatively high rates of juvenile delinquency changed completely from 1900 to 1920. While the rates of offending remained the same, the people changed. Thus, it is not types of people but rather types of places that are important for explaining rates of crime.
	* They were theorizing in a highly dynamic, urban area going through massive change. From [[Park and Burgess]]: urban societies are more heterogeneous in terms of cultures and values, more anonymous, and are more likely to rely upon formal social control mechanisms.
	* Most theories of the time were focused on biology or how certain types of people were more likely to commit crime.
	* Rates of crime were highest in the interstitial areas of the city (mixed-use and commercial areas).
* Neighborhoods with high rates of crime are going through social disorganization -> **inability of the community to realize the common values of its residents and maintain effective social control over those who disrupt the order**. #definition 
	* Social disorganization is the breakdown of informal social controls leading to an inability for the community to realize its collective values and stop deviance.
* **Low socioeconomic status**, **ethnic heterogeneity**, and **high residential mobility** are likely to lead to social disorganization.
* These three factors are then likely to affect the **ability of a community to supervise and control teenage peer groups**, **local friendship networks**, and **local participation in formal and voluntary organizations**. These mediating factors are what then directly affect the level of crime and violence in an area.

### Details

* [[Shaw and McKay]] originally formulated it as 5 main factors:
	* **Low economic status**
	* **Ethnic heterogeneity** (we fear the other and thus it’s harder to form ties).
	* **Residential mobility** (takes a long time for ties to form, and they can’t form when everybody is moving around).
	* **Family disruption** (harder to supervise adolescents). From [[sampsonCommunityStructureCrime1989]]. Community-level family disruption has a direct positive effect on the prevalence of street-corner teenage gangs.
	* **Urbanization**. Urban communities have a decreased capacity for social control. Urbanization weakens local kinship and friendship networks and impedes social participation in local affairs. [[sampsonCommunityStructureCrime1989]].
* Mediating mechanisms (e.g., poorer neighborhoods are less likely to have the ability to supervise children, less likely to have dense friendship networks, less likely to participate in formal and voluntary organizations):
	* **Ability of a community to supervise and control teenage peer groups**
		* Gangs develop from unsupervised play groups. Socially disorganized communities with extensive youth gangs are expected to also have higher rates of adult crime. No hard and fast dividing line between the juvenile offending and adult offending. It is argued the two merge into each other by imperceptible gradations.
	* **Local friendship networks**
		* When residents form local social ties, capacity for social control is increased because they are able to: **1)** recognize strangers and are more apt to engage in guardianship (protecting against victimization) and **2)** exert structural constraints on the deviant behavior of residents in the community. Denser networks wherein more individuals are connected to one another result in less delinquency because the individual is subject to the reactions of all members in the network.
	* **Local participation in formal and voluntary organizations**
		* When links between community institutions are weak, the capacity of a community to defend its local interests is weakened. Also weakens local social-control functions regarding youth.
* These factors lead to community social disorganization which in turn increases crime and delinquency.
	* It is the inability of a community to realize the common values of its residents and maintain effective social controls.
	* Based on the [[systemic model]] which is the idea that a neighborhood is a complex system of friendship and kinship and formal and informal associational ties.

### Advancements

* [[Robert J. Sampson]] proposes the next big advancement in [[Collective efficacy|collective efficacy]].
	* Social disorganization faced a lot of criticisms:
		* Are disorganized neighborhoods actually disorganized? Is there an organization which is conducive to crime and disorder?
			* Dense personal ties and networks exist in disordered networks. In fact, they often can facilitate the commission of crime. They do not facilitate the creation of prosocial resources of effective social regulation. Social ties have positive and negative effects, and they are not inherently prosocial and egalitarian.
		* Many neighborhoods (particularly in urban areas) seemed to be able to effectively self-regulate without there being many thick, dense social ties between individuals living in the neighborhood.
		* Neighborhoods are deeply shaped by external processes, and they do not naturally arise. External political, economic, and social forces come to bear on shaping how neighborhoods grow, evolve, and change.
	* The goal was to preserve the idea that there is community-level or neighborhood-level variation in rates of crime.
* [[browningIlluminatingDownsideSocial2009]] -> introduces [[Negotiated coexistence]]. Briefly, it is the idea that collective efficacy loses its protective power when network cohesion is high. Individuals essentially use the social capital they've accumulated in positive interactions with others to shield themselves from sanction.
