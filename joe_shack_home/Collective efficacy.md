An advancement of [[Social disorganization|social disorganization]] by [[Robert J. Sampson]].

* It is based on the ideas of *social cohesion* and a *shared expectation for control*.
* Accepts the idea from social disorganization theory that [[Social control theory|social control theory]] is a collective challenge not attributable to the characteristics of individuals alone.
* Unlike SD, it relaxes the assumption for strong neighborhood ties. Institutional mechanisms, alone, may be sufficient, and working trust and social interaction are needed on some level but are not necessarily the most important elements.
* One proposed definition of collective efficacy is that *it is an activation of latent community resources to achieve an intended effect*.
* Another proposed definition is the willingness to intervene on behalf of the common good.
* The logic of collective efficacy is as follows: think of coming together as a community to solve a problem. On some level, you have a basic trust and shared sense of values. But you are not necessarily going to be everyoneâ€™s friend.
* Of course, it is not all about local residents working collectively together to solve their own problems. What happens within neighborhoods is strongly shaped by socioeconomic and housing factors.
* Collective efficacy can also be a negative force in the sense that residents can marshal resources to stop the development of e.g., low-income housing.
