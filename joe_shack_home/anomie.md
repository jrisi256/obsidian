## Written assignment for Darrell's CRIM512 class

My notes will be coming from a written assignment I did for Darrell's class. For context, I will provide the questions from the written assignment. Then, my answers will follow.

1. His primary concern was to explain the paradox of how a society and culture, which are seemingly structured to produce certain behaviors, could under certain circumstances produce behavior contrary to what was expected i.e. deviant behavior. A secondary concern would also have been to provide a complementary theory to social disorganization theory since Merton didn’t view slums as being inherently disorganized but as having their own internal methods and processes for achieving the success-goals as specified by the culture.
	1. Which social/cultural structures exert pressures on people to become criminogenic?
	2. Middle-range theory (linking theoretical and empirical approaches). Pointing to something specific in how societies are structured and malintegration can lead to deviance.
	3. Comparative. Why are the pressures to deviate not spread out evenly across different stratums?
	4. Intended and unintended consequences which result from the organization of society.
2. First, the culture of a group of people defines what should be the goals everyone is striving for or what constitutes success. The social structures then dictate the acceptable means through which people can achieve these goals.
	1. Second, members of the group will have differential access to the acceptable means of achieving the culturally agreed upon goals. This can be very broad: cultural capital (speak politely, work ethic, how to navigate the workplace), bodily capital, economic capital, social capital.  
	2. The third and final factor to consider is norm erosion or when the emphasis upon achieving success becomes more important than following the acceptable patterns of behavior to achieve that success. This happens as a normal response for the subset of people who don’t have as much of an opportunity to achieve the cultural goals. When this happens in a social system wherein the rules lose their legitimacy for some subset of people, the society is in a state of anomie.
	3. Anomie results from the three factors above interacting and being “malintegrated”.
3. To me, the two most clear symbols of American success that Merton points out are accumulation of wealth (economic affluence) and rapid social mobility. A third symbol is a bit harder for me to identify, but I would say something akin to status, reputation or recognition. There is an important emphasis placed on being someone of prestige and renown. Occupational status/public recognition: May not make a lot of money, but you have status, e.g. professor. 4th one that Darrell brings up, full citizenship. Are the avenues to get full citizenship equally available? Are they blocked for African-Americans in a much more profound way? One way we can think about this is by looking at intermarriage rates. And African-Americans are the group least likely to be intermarried. Birther movement and Obama.
4. One of the core aspects of Merton’s anomie theory is that certain stratum are going to have differential access to legitimate means of achieving success. In other words, there is an inequality of means. If all groups actually had equal access, in other words if there was no inequality of means, anomie would not result.
5. First there is the fact that different stratums of society have differential access to the legitimate means of achieving the culturally prescribed notions of success. Second, a fact specific to the USA, it is stressed that all individuals in all stratums of society have equal opportunity to the culturally prescribed notions of success. This is not the case as established above, and it causes frustration to emerge for people since they believe they should have access to success (as promised to them). Norm erosion happens, and they begin to seek out illegitimate means. Weak normative commitment to acceptable means. Trust erosion and trust in the system.
6. Addressed a little bit question 2. For Merton, anomie refers to a social system not an individual. It refers to a social system in which there is a breakdown in social standards and social cohesion because the rules have lost legitimacy. Enough people believe their society is keeping their legitimate aspirations from being achieved in legitimate ways. The lack of shared norms (or perhaps the fear that others don’t share the same norms as you) then causes neighborhoods to fall into disarray. Weakened attachment to norms, norms lose their force, norm erosion/attenuation of norms. Not just breaking the law, norms around education, family structure, etc. Makes crime more subjectively acceptable.
7. The focus is on relative deprivation. Culturally prescribed markers of success will be different from group to group. As a result, what may constitute as being a success in one culture may not count as being successful in a different culture. Individuals will then experience different levels of deprivation relative to the goals prescribed by their culture. Relative deprivation comes from a study commissioned by the USA Army about differential levels of troop morale. Found married men had lower morale (relatively deprived), African-Americans from the South vs. African-Americans from the North had higher morale, comes back to reference groups. Southern African-Americans just didn’t compare themselves to White Americans (think of the caste system in India). And the military life treated them much better.
8. Addressed a little bit in question 6. I’ll add that individuals can be experiencing what Leo Srole terms anomia which refers to how much or little an individual believes they have legitimate access to achieving their goals. In Merton’s 1964 piece Anomie, Anomia, and Social Interaction he makes the distinction between anomie as a group variable vs. anomia as an individual variable. “Anomie, then, is a condition of the social surround, not a condition of particular people. People are confronted by substantial anomie when… they cannot rely upon… the behavior of others will be in rough accord with standards jointly regarded as legitimate. To prevent conceptual confusion, therefore, different terms are required to distinguish between the anomic state of individuals and the anomic state of the social system...” (page 227).
9. Some may categorize anomie as a strain theory since part of the theory involves the fact individuals are under strain. They want to follow the legitimate ways of achieving success, but they are blocked from doing so. The resulting strain on an individual causes dissonance where they either must accept they cannot achieve success or find other illegitimate ways to achieve success. It’s worth noting though in The Making of Criminology Revisited: An Oral History Of Merton’s Anomie Paradigm Merton rejects the notion his anomie theory is a strain theory (page 21).
	1. Merton and Durkheim’s theory of anomie both describe situations of “normlessness” or what happens when the norms of society which usually govern behavior fail to do so. Merton expands upon Durkheim’s original ideas by adding in the concept of culturally shared symbols of success and considering differential access to success by social stratum. This specific emphasis on social stratum is a key difference between Merton and Durkheim as Durkheim did not consider differential access to success. Merton also, unlike Durkheim, did not look at all to biological considerations when trying to explain the actions of man as Merton viewed most of man’s impulses and actions as being the result of social forces (Clinard, Theoretical Implications of Anomie and Deviant Behavior, page 11).
10. Cohen argues in Delinquent Boys: The Culture of the Gang people denied access to the culturally prescribed notions of success not only develop illegitimate means to achieve those notions of success but then also go on to form their own subcultures with modified norms and acceptable behaviors. However, I think Hagedorn in Homeboys, New Jacks, and Anomie presents a compelling, empirical case for why people consistently denied access to success don’t have such different norms from the mainstream.
	1. I think groups who experience long-term anomie will not only have higher rates of crime historically, but the material and immaterial quality of their lives will also be poorer. For example, they’ll have worse education outcomes, worse employment prospects, more health problems, and less accumulated wealth.
11. There are a few remedies I see being implied by Merton. One can be strengthening your social structures and ensuring people are more inclined to follow the legitimate ways of achieving success rather than achieving success at any cost. Another remedy would be ensuring more equal access to the legitimate ways of achieving success for all subgroups. Another, harder to implement, remedy would be to change the culturally prescribed notions of success.
12. I believe anomie theory is better suited for explaining property crimes rather than violent crimes since property crimes are a more direct way of achieving success in the USA (i.e. accumulating wealth and advancing your social station). However insofar as violent crimes can also help one achieve success, anomie theory would then provide explanations for why the crime was committed. Attenuation of norms can lead to any crimes being committed, I suppose. And decline in trust.
13. Merton stresses there are five adaptations or stances one can take in relation to the opportunity-structure and culturally prescribed notions of success in your group. Not all of these adaptations result in deviant behavior and even the ones which do (retreat, innovators, rebels) are not always going to engage in deviant behavior in that adaptive mode.
	1. Merton expands upon this in his 1964 piece, Anomie, Anomia, and Social Interaction, by saying we also need to consider: A) The broader anomic context of the society in which people live as a more anomic society will allow for more opportunities for anomic individuals to deviate and B) The interactions of anomic and non-anomic people in what Merton terms differential association. Interactions between and amongst these two groups can greatly affect the chances of a crime happening (which is also connected to point A since the degree of anomie already present in the society will also affect the chances of a crime happening).
	2. I’ll conclude by pointing out that Cloward and Ohlin in Delinquency and Opportunity also introduce the key concept of differential access to illegitimate opportunities (in addition to Merton’s idea of differential access to legitimate opportunities). For example in slums, adolescents have much more access to adults who’ve achieved success through illegitimate means and thus will have more of an opportunity themselves to practice those illegitimate means.
14. One fact about crime that’s consistent with anomie theory is the fact that crime tends to be most prevalent in places of concentrated poverty. People in these areas would have the least access to legitimate means of achieving success. Another fact consistent with anomie theory would be the age-crime curve. Younger people have less access to the material resources needed for achieving success so it would make sense they would be more likely to deviate.
15. For starters, both anomie and social disorganization are theories which claim deviancy causing elements primarily do not originate in the individual (although the two theories locate deviancy in different ways). More crucially, both anomie theory and social disorganization theory describe how deviancy arises in certain groups/places when the norms governing behavior are weakened.
16. Sampson’s collective efficacy is a property of a social system in which neighbors have some degree of social cohesion combined with a willingness to intervene on behalf of the common good for their neighborhood. Collective efficacy can then be thought of as the opposite of anomie. Neighbors believe in the norms of society i.e. through legitimate means you can achieve success. There is a shared sense of norms and trust that everyone will follow in those norms. In this sense, both theories realize how neighborhoods can become criminogenic as norms erode. Methodologically both collective efficacy and anomie are measured using surveys, and both use similar questions to measure the phenomenon.
17. Some of the more illustrative quotes from Merton:
	1. “It is only when a system of cultural values extols, virtually above all else, certain common symbols of success for the population at large while its social structure rigorously restricts or completely eliminates access to approved modes of acquiring these symbols for a considerable part of the same population, that antisocial behavior ensues on a considerable scale.” #quote [[mertonSocialStructureAnomie1938]](page 680).
	2. "... it becomes clear, from this paradigm, that rates of social interaction between anomics and non-anomics are assumed to differ in collectivities with differing degrees of anomie and that such patterns of differential association will in turn affect the rates of deviant behavior.” (Merton 1964, Anomie, Anomia, and Social Interaction: Contexts of Deviant Behavior, page 237).
	3. “In short, critics fail to see that Merton’s SS&A was intended as a case study of one delimited phenomenon. Merton was not proposing that cultural goals involve only the pursuit of pecuniary success; again, many goals might exist and might vary across social contexts.” (Cullen and Messner 2007, The Making Of Criminology Revisited: An Oral History of Merton’s Anomie Paradigm, page 23).
	4. These three quotes illustrate nicely: A) Merton’s explicit explanation of why the USA has such a crime problem relative to other Western nations in relation to anomie theory, B) His evolving stance concerning how anomie at the structural level interacts with anomia at the individual level and C) how anomie theory can be more broadly applied to other contexts to understand how different norms and goals would manifest deviant behavior. Of particular interest in this regard would be Merton’s 1957 paper Priorities in Scientific Discovery: A Chapter in the Sociology of Science in which he examines how disputes in science over who discovered something first is directly related to the success-goals espoused by the institution of science.  

### General thoughts from class in response to my assignment

* Merton is pushing back against biological arguments for man as being in a natural state of self-interest. He’s also pushing back against the primacy of capitalistic values and economic growth as being the ultimate goal for society. He talks about this in one of the pieces too, and I think I have notes on this… which is explained a bit more clearly elsewhere.
* Cohen on why it didn’t affect girls. 1) School was a courtship system and a way for them to meet a mate. So didn’t make sense to deviate. 2) The skills being taught to girls were more relevant to their culturally prescribed notions of success (child-rearing, home economics, cooking) 3) Gender was already wrapped up in ideas of deference, following authority.
* Hagedorn rebuts Cohen, and others, people think Cohen was too either/or. People can hold subcultural views and mainstream cultural views.

### Overlap between social disorganization, collective efficacy, and anomie

* They are the inverse of each other. Shared norms, cohesion, trust. Willingness to intervene for the common good and must believe you'll be effective. Moral/Legal cynicism (lack of collective efficacy) is kind of anomie.
* Overlap between anomie and social disorganization.
	* Both address issues of culture.
	* Measure them very similarly.
	* Both macro-social theories.
	* Both of them have elements have "norm attenuation" or "erosion of norms".
	* Both of them are caused by issues of residential instability, poverty, and particularly "stratification" and income inequality -> Stakes in conformity.
	* Both are "lack of integration" theories of how the different aspects of society aren't very well integrated.
	* Both of them leave out the broader social, political, historical forces which lead to why certain areas become socially disorganized or experience anomie. They leave out issues of "power", who controls the resources (think of issues of segregation in housing). It becomes incredibly hard to move out of the inner city (especially for African-Americans).
	* Also they leave out "labeling" theory and the social construction of crime. Although Merton much more sympathetic to those who "critical" readings of criminology and invoke Marx and social construction.
	* Opportunity to commit crime is... sort of there. But they never really clearly expand upon it or build it into their theories.
* Methodological similarity
	* [[Multilevel modeling]].
	* Both are using macro-level variables... collective traits of the community... collective efficacy gets at its measurements by aggregating individual responses. And Merton in the 1964 piece advocates for a similar approach.
	* Going back to [[starkDeviantPlacesTheory1987]] diagram... what could we add? Anomie and collective efficacy in the middle column. In the first column, make it concentrated poverty.

<mark>Blau and Blau -> Reflects anomie and not so much social disorganization. Emphasis on inequality. In social disorganization the emphasis on poverty. For Merton and anomie, it's poverty in the midst of plenty, it's inequality. Especially true in the USA. Anyway, find support for their hypothesis.</mark>

Criticisms: Ignore cultural characteristics or rather the norms in the community. They ignore the mediating variables.

Also, no consistent support for their hypothesis. People find conflicting results. -> Talk about Land's article for a little bit and how Blau and Blau don't account for collinearity -> ALSO use a global measure of inequality AND use a global measure of violence. You have to disaggregate.
