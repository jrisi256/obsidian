1) First, what types of sentences can judges choose from to give to offenders?  Second, define and contrast the following:  indeterminate vs. determinate sentences, presumptive vs. advisory sentencing guidelines, and mandatory minimum sentences.

Judges have a variety of options to choose from when deciding how to administer punishment for offenders. Options include:

- **The Death Penalty**: It is legal across many states in the USA (not all), but it is very rarely applied (also cannot be used for adolescents). The death penalty is only available as a punishment for 1st degree murder. Because of the severity of the punishment, there are many stipulations attached to the administering of this punishment e.g. automatic appellate review is usually applied when an offender is sentenced to death, judges can overturn the verdict of the jury in select cases.
    
- **Incarceration**: This is available in every state for a wide variety of crimes. Usually sentences of less than a year are served at the local/county jail while those of more than a year are served in state prison. This punishment is widely prescribed and frequently imposed so much so that the USA is the world leader in the number and rate of people incarcerated.
    
- **Probation**: [[Probation]] imposes a set of conditions on the offender (e.g. periodic drug tests, cannot leave the state) who is then released back into the community. If the violations are violated, they can be sent to jail/prison. It was developed primarily as a means of diverting juveniles and less serious offenders from having to be incarcerated since it has been observed sending less serious offenders to jail/prison can have serious deleterious effects.
    
- **[[Intermediate Sanctions]]**: These punishments are rarely used. They typically involve boot camps, house arrest, electronic monitoring, community service, and/or monetary penalties. Some argue these represent viable alternatives to mass incarceration. Others are less optimistic because of issues around net widening as well as general public support for punitive measures. 
    
- **Indeterminate Sentencing vs. Determinate Sentencing**: _[[Indeterminate sentencing]]_ involves a legislature specifying a minimum and maximum sentence for each class of offense. Judges then impose a minimum and a maximum or just a maximum for the offender given the circumstances of the case. Parole boards then decide when the offender is ready to be released back into society. Critics allege this allows for too much discretion and individual bias to creep into decision-making since judges and parole boards have enormous leeway in deciding how long to incarcerate someone. Additionally they claim parole boards aren’t adequately set-up to accurately determine if a person is ready or not to rejoin their community. Conservative critics allege this process isn’t tough enough on offenders as judges and parole boards tend towards leniency rather than harshness. _[[Determinate sentencing]]_ is when the legislature provides a presumptive range of confinement for each offense or class of offenses. Judges then impose a fixed term of years within this range. Offenders are to serve the full length of their sentence minus time off for good behavior while incarcerated. Proponents argue this ensures offenders get their just desert punishment and not undue leniency while also ensuring individual discretion doesn’t lead to biased outcomes for certain groups of people.                            

- **Presumptive vs. Advisory sentencing guidelines**: [[Sentencing guidelines]] are legislatively authorized rules which give recommendations on appropriate punishments for given crime types. They’re typically based on the seriousness of the offense and the offender’s prior record. Presumptive guidelines require judges to follow them, and they must give explicit, written reasons when they deviate from them. Advisory guidelines are recommendations which judges are free to follow or not.

- **[[Mandatory Minimum Sentences]]**: The legislature requires certain crimes or certain individuals with a criminal history must serve prison time for the crime committed. They can be circumvented by prosecutors who avoid pressing charges which would trigger the mandatory minimums.

2) In his article, Michael Tonry evaluates sentencing guidelines favorably as a policy, but he harshly criticizes the federal sentencing guidelines. Why is that?  Is this a contradiction?

I don’t believe it is a contradiction. Federal sentencing guidelines are different from state sentencing guidelines on three key dimensions which has led [[tonryFiftyYearsAmerican2019]] to view the federal guidelines as a failure even as he views sentencing guidelines, as a whole, quite favorably:

1. The “tough-on-crime” politics of the day won out on the commission which drew up the guidelines. This led to large reductions in the use of less severe punishments, like probation.
    
2. The guidelines themselves are too complicated and detailed. It led to large resistance from judges who greatly resented being micromanaged.
    
3. Eventually the guidelines were found to be unconstitutional causing them to become advisory guidelines rather than mandatory guidelines.

Tonry’s rationale:

1. Tonry views sentencing guidelines as most effective when they don’t succumb to “tough-on-crime” politics and instead attempt to balance discretion with fairness and punitiveness. This balance leads to appropriate levels of punishment combined with leniency. It also allows for biases to be smoothed out which is the result of discretion not being bounded. For Tonry, the federal guidelines’ overemphasis of punitiveness comes at the expense of appropriate leniency but also at the expense of reducing biases.
    
2. Tonry fundamentally views it as impossible to standardize sentences across states or at the federal level. The country is too diverse, and the context of each jurisdiction and case is too specific to feasibly create a system that could deal with each case on its own terms with the appropriate level of specificity. Because the federal sentencing guidelines attempted this sisyphean task, it doomed them to failure. State sentencing guidelines have the ability to be more aware of the local context, and they’re also able to strike a better balance of being prescriptive (what _should_ punishment look like for certain crimes) AND descriptive (what does punishment _currently_ look like for certain crimes). Successful state sentencing commissions, in Tonry’s words, realize that “the law is local”.
    
3. Tonry views presumptive sentencing guidelines as the best way to realize the benefits of sentencing guidelines (improved consistency and reduced disparities). Voluntary or advisory sentencing guidelines are not nearly as effective because there is no force behind them. Without that force, judges tend to make whatever decision it is they would’ve normally made.

In conclusion, Tonry views the federal sentencing guidelines as poor implementations of an otherwise good policy idea.

3) Pick one of the policy choices made by the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing when they originally developed their guidelines, and tell how you think it should or should not be made differently today.

The decision to not include prison capacity as a factor when developing guidelines seems like a major oversight, and I believe it absolutely should be a factor when crafting guidelines. Additionally there should have been a role on the commission for representatives from the correctional department. The article doesn’t delve too deeply into why the legislature did not consider incorporating prison capacity when crafting the guidelines other than mentioning it was almost never brought up in discussions. This seems odd since at the time Senator Kennedy’s proposal and Minnesota’s system incorporated prison capacity into crafting their guidelines. Representatives from the corrections department were axed from the commission to limit board size, and it was rationalized that they could speak during public hearings.

Hindsight is 2020, but even so mass incarceration is one of the major challenges facing the USA today. Mass incarceration led to the hollowing out of poor and minority communities, it hasn’t made the country any safer, and it has led to overcrowded jails and prisons. The criminal justice system is just that, a system. The parts need to be working together in harmony to ensure justice is fairly meted out. If what is happening in the courtroom is completely divorced from the realities of jail/prison, it will lead to imbalances in the system which is exactly what happened.

By creating guidelines which explicitly take into account prison capacity, harmony is more readily achieved through the system. Prosecutors and judges would need to balance the severity of the crimes presented before them with the realities of the ability of the state to actually incarcerate them. This would hopefully lead to a narrowing or a focusing on those offenders who are actually the highest risk or threat.
