* Definition of legal cynicism from the aforementioned paper: 
	* "Legal cynicism refers to a cultural orientation in which the law and the agents of its enforcement, such as the police and courts, are viewed as illegitimate, unresponsive, and ill equipped to ensure public safety. Legal cynicism resolves the aforementioned paradox—while individuals may believe in the substance of the law, antagonism toward and mistrust of the agents of the law may propel some individuals toward violence simply because they feel they cannot rely upon the police to help them resolve grievances. Under such conditions, violence can serve as an additional form of problem-solving behavior in one’s cultural repertoire (Hannerz 1969; Black 1983), augmenting but not necessarily replacing other types of problem-solving behaviors such as calling the police." (pg. 3 of the PDF, pg. 1191 of the document).
