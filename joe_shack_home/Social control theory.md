## Introduction to Social Control (from Darrell Steffensmeier CRIM512 Assignment)

### Introduction

- Different starting point from other theories. Assumption is rather Hobbesian (state of nature for man is nasty, short and brutish). People, unless otherwise constrained, will commit deviant acts. The challenge is to identify why people don’t deviate more often, or to identify why people conform as much as they do.
  
- One of the reasons we don’t deviate is attachment.

### Definition of attachment

- Being sensitive to and caring about the opinions others hold of us.
  
- It can also mean being concerned with following the norms of your group or the broader society (because you care what others think of you).
  
- “Respect is the source of the law.” - Very closely related idea. We respect those making the rules, and we value their opinions and rules they make. Don’t want to disappoint them.
  
- We form attachments to people by investing in relationships with them.
  
- Subtle point. Attachment can produce internal changes which then manifest in changes in behavior. It may also simply embed people more firmly into roles of conformity where their internal state may not have changed all that much, but the costs are much higher for committing crime now. Relates back to the state of nature for man (short, nasty, brutish).
  
- See [[hirschiCausesDelinquency1969]].

### Examples of attachment

- You can be attached to all sorts of things… your hometown, your dog.
  
- For theories of crime and deviance though, there are a few things criminologists have honed in on as being important sources of attachment for preventing crime:
  
	- **Being attached to your parents as a child**. Feeling like you can confide in them, feeling like the rules they make are fair, would the child like to be like their parents when they grow up. In general, bonds of affection with an adult are very important for children growing up to help them from becoming deviant.

	- **Being attached to school and your teachers**. School is the most important factor for socializing children, preparing them for the real world, and also helping less fortunate children improve their situation. It’s important for children to become attached to school as a result to bind them to conformity
  
### Relevance of [[attachment]]
  
* Not being attached means you don’t care what others think of you, and you don’t care if others think less of you for breaking the rules.
  
* Frees you to deviate if you aren’t attached.
  
* Doesn’t guarantee you will deviate but increases the probability.
  
* As we lose respect for others or as their opinions become less important to us, we become less attached to doing what they’d expect and following their rules.
  
* This concept is also very important in [[Life course theory|life-course]] studies and why delinquent children do not become delinquent adults.
  
	- One explanation is we build attachments and relationships to others which help increase our stakes in conformity.
	  
	- One such attachment is [[marriage]]. VERY IMPORTANT - It isn’t the act of getting married solely which induces attachment and conformity. It’s a marriage built on a strong relationship with close emotional ties and mutual investment. The reciprocal nature of the relationship means you care about your spouse and not disappointing them. Increases the cost of committing a crime.
	  
	- Similarly the other important attachment is to the [[labor force]]. QUALITY MATTERS just as in marriage. Having the job be stable, feeling like your boss is invested in you and vice versa. Induces similar effects as a healthy marriage, increases the costs of crime.
	  
- We say these attachments exert informal social control. Unlike formal social control which exists explicitly to control crime, informal social control controls crime as a by-product of relationships established for other purposes.

## Introduction to Self-Control

* Early childhood and parenting models (supervision/monitoring, recognize deviant behavior, effectively sanction) -> [[self-control ]]-> crime. Opportunity is somewhere in here too. It becomes a stable, lifelong characteristic or a character trait. Not going to develop as you get older.
* See [[gottfredsonGeneralTheoryCrime1990]], [[prattEmpiricalStatusGottfredson2000]], and [[naCanSelfControlChange2012]] for good overviews of the theory.

### Definition of self-control

* **Self-control** -> The ability to avoid criminal acts whatever the circumstances (short-sighted, impulsive, risk-taking, value excitement, self-centered, enjoy physical exertion). Can be a bit tautological. 

### Criticisms

* Opportunity is introduced haphazardly as an out to cover their bases.
* Factor analysis seems to indicate risk-taking stands out as a predictive factor. Is this really the same as low self-control?
* Physical vs. intellectually oriented, is this really part of self-control (class and racially biased perhaps)?
* Gets really tautological. Too simple. And it stereotypes/stigmatizes criminals (good guys, bad guys). Ignores crucial variables.
* Psychologists use "self-regulation" (much more developed). Self-control as a muscle.

### Connections to the life-course

* Hirschi/Gottfredson vs. Moffit -> Hirschi really believes low social-control is socially caused whereas Moffit believes it's genetic. Both believe it's pretty stable. Both believe parents and schools play a big role. Another difference is Moffit believes you're baked by ages 2-3 and Hirschi/Gottfredson think it's by age 8-10. Gottfredson more receptive to the genetic stuff.
