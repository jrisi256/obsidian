## Overview of Social Control Theory (from Darrell Steffensmeier CRIM512 Assignment)

**Hirschi’s Theory of Social Control**

1. **A Different Starting Point**
	1. Before we get into the guts of theory, we should make clear Hirschi is coming at the issue of crime from a different angle than other theorists. Specifically many theorists are trying to answer the question, “Why do people commit crime?” Hirschi thinks this is the wrong starting point. The right question is, “**Why do people conform**?”
	2. Hirschi assumes the motivation to commit _crime_ is constant across everybody or in other words everybody has criminal impulses at roughly the same frequency.
	3. An action isn’t considered a crime unless it comes into conflict with law or agreed upon rules in society.
	4. People who then commit crimes are those who don’t have much reason not to commit a crime (the default position for humanity). Crime will simply be what’s most expedient for getting what you want. Most of what you do probably wouldn’t be considered criminal. However some of it will be, but what would it matter to you if it gets you what you want?
	5. Hirschi goes on to theorize humans largely conform to rules as a result of the **social bonds** we develop. This forms the basis for Hirschi’s theory. 
	   
2. **Social Bonds and Social Control**
   
	1. Hirschi’s theory can be stated succinctly, “Crime arises when social bonds to conventional persons and institutions are weak or absent.”
	   
	2. Social bonds are the ties and relationships we create with other people and institutions. We invest ourselves into them and as a result we care about them. Hirschi makes it clear we can have social bonds to antisocial persons and institutions which introduce deviant behavior not conforming behavior. When social bonds are created with prosocial persons and institutions they help to establish conformity. Social bonds have **four components** which make it clear how conformity is established.
	   
	3. **Four Components**
	   
		1. **Attachment**
			1. Attachment is the emotional connection you develop with others. You’re sensitive to and care about the opinions they hold of you.
			2. It also means you’re concerned with following the norms of your group or the broader society (because you care what others think of you).
			3. “Respect is the source of the law.” You respect those making the rules, and you value their opinions and rules they make. You don’t want to disappoint them.
			4. We don’t want to let down those whose opinion we value so we follow the rules and conform.
			   
		2. **Commitment**
			1. This is considered the _rational_ component in conformity. People through living in organized society acquire stakes in various people and institutions (school, careers, neighborhoods).
			2. When considering deviant behavior, these investments or _commitments_ change the calculus of one’s decision-making since one now has much more to lose as a result of their deviant behavior. There wouldn’t only be emotional costs in the form of lost attachments but also material losses.
			   
		3. **Involvement**
			1. One’s social bonds require time, energy, and resources in order for them to be  maintained and grow. As a result, people become busy. People will then not have the time, energy, or resources to become engaged in illegitimate activities because their focus will be on their legitimate activities.
			   
		4. **Belief**
			1. The extent to which an individual believes in the rules of society and the extent to which they trust the rulemakers of society (courts, governments, teachers, police officers, parents). One _believes_ the rules to be valid. As a result, the fairness of the rules and their enforcement entails that one has a responsibility to follow them.
			2. This is closely related to attachment and “respect is the source of the law”. It isn’t an emotional bond in this instance which guarantees conforming behavior instead it’s more of a conceptual agreement to follow the rules of society because they’re fundamentally fair.
		
	1. An important point to make is all these components of social bonds aren’t developed or cultivated by people for the purpose of controlling deviancy. The **social control** they exert over people is purely a byproduct of the relationship being formed in the first place.
	   
	2. **Examples** - Hirschi identifies two early sources of social bonds which are instrumental in producing social control.
	   
		1. **Being attached to your parents as a child**. Feeling like you can confide in them, feeling like the rules they make are fair, would the child like to be like their parents when they grow up. In general, bonds of affection with an adult are very important for children growing up to help them from becoming deviant.
		   
		2. **Being attached to school and your teachers**. School is the most important factor for socializing children, preparing them for the real world, and also helping less fortunate children improve their situation. It’s important for children to become attached to school as a result to bind them to conformity.
		   
	1. **Relevance** or **Development of Deviancy** - As stated earlier, deviancy occurs due to weak or absent social bonds. Each of the components can then help to illuminate why deviance occurs.
	   
		1. **Attachment**: Not being attached means you don’t care what others think of you, and you don’t care if others think less of you for breaking the rules. It _frees_ you to deviate. As we lose respect for others or as their opinions become less important to us, we become less attached to doing what they’d expect and following their rules.
		   
		2. **Commitment**: Not having a lot of commitments changes the calculus of committing a crime. You don’t have as much to lose as a result. You aren’t risking or jeopardizing any material gains you have accrued.
		   
		3. **Involvement**: An individual who has more free time, energy, or resources due to a lack of involvement in legitimate activities will (in conjunction with other factors) be more likely to engage in criminal activity. Recent research has indicated this factor may not be as important as Hirschi initially claimed although Hirschi tended to rank this one lower in terms of importance anyway.
		   
		4. **Belief**: If an individual doesn’t believe in the validity of the rules or the system/persons producing the rules, they’re more likely to break those rules. They don’t see the inherent value in following them.

## Introduction to Social Control (from Darrell Steffensmeier CRIM512 Assignment)

### Introduction

- Different starting point from other theories. Assumption is rather Hobbesian (state of nature for man is nasty, short and brutish). People, unless otherwise constrained, will commit deviant acts. The challenge is to identify why people don’t deviate more often, or to identify why people conform as much as they do.
  
- One of the reasons we don’t deviate is attachment.

### Definition of attachment

- Being sensitive to and caring about the opinions others hold of us.
  
- It can also mean being concerned with following the norms of your group or the broader society (because you care what others think of you).
  
- “Respect is the source of the law.” - Very closely related idea. We respect those making the rules, and we value their opinions and rules they make. Don’t want to disappoint them.
  
- We form attachments to people by investing in relationships with them.
  
- Subtle point. Attachment can produce internal changes which then manifest in changes in behavior. It may also simply embed people more firmly into roles of conformity where their internal state may not have changed all that much, but the costs are much higher for committing crime now. Relates back to the state of nature for man (short, nasty, brutish).
  
- See [[hirschiCausesDelinquency1969]].

### Examples of attachment

- You can be attached to all sorts of things… your hometown, your dog.
  
- For theories of crime and deviance though, there are a few things criminologists have honed in on as being important sources of attachment for preventing crime:
  
	- **Being attached to your parents as a child**. Feeling like you can confide in them, feeling like the rules they make are fair, would the child like to be like their parents when they grow up. In general, bonds of affection with an adult are very important for children growing up to help them from becoming deviant.

	- **Being attached to school and your teachers**. School is the most important factor for socializing children, preparing them for the real world, and also helping less fortunate children improve their situation. It’s important for children to become attached to school as a result to bind them to conformity
  
### Relevance of [[attachment]]
  
* Not being attached means you don’t care what others think of you, and you don’t care if others think less of you for breaking the rules.
  
* Frees you to deviate if you aren’t attached.
  
* Doesn’t guarantee you will deviate but increases the probability.
  
* As we lose respect for others or as their opinions become less important to us, we become less attached to doing what they’d expect and following their rules.
  
* This concept is also very important in [[Life course theory|life-course]] studies and why delinquent children do not become delinquent adults.
  
	- One explanation is we build attachments and relationships to others which help increase our stakes in conformity.
	  
	- One such attachment is [[marriage]]. VERY IMPORTANT - It isn’t the act of getting married solely which induces attachment and conformity. It’s a marriage built on a strong relationship with close emotional ties and mutual investment. The reciprocal nature of the relationship means you care about your spouse and not disappointing them. Increases the cost of committing a crime.
	  
	- Similarly the other important attachment is to the [[labor force]]. QUALITY MATTERS just as in marriage. Having the job be stable, feeling like your boss is invested in you and vice versa. Induces similar effects as a healthy marriage, increases the costs of crime.
	  
- We say these attachments exert informal social control. Unlike formal social control which exists explicitly to control crime, informal social control controls crime as a by-product of relationships established for other purposes.

## Introduction to Self-Control

* Early childhood and parenting models (supervision/monitoring, recognize deviant behavior, effectively sanction) -> [[self-control ]]-> crime. Opportunity is somewhere in here too. It becomes a stable, lifelong characteristic or a character trait. Not going to develop as you get older.
* See [[gottfredsonGeneralTheoryCrime1990]], [[prattEmpiricalStatusGottfredson2000]], and [[naCanSelfControlChange2012]] for good overviews of the theory.

### Definition of self-control

* **Self-control** -> The ability to avoid criminal acts whatever the circumstances (short-sighted, impulsive, risk-taking, value excitement, self-centered, enjoy physical exertion). Can be a bit tautological. 

### Criticisms

* Opportunity is introduced haphazardly as an out to cover their bases.
* Factor analysis seems to indicate risk-taking stands out as a predictive factor. Is this really the same as low self-control?
* Physical vs. intellectually oriented, is this really part of self-control (class and racially biased perhaps)?
* Gets really tautological. Too simple. And it stereotypes/stigmatizes criminals (good guys, bad guys). Ignores crucial variables.
* Psychologists use "self-regulation" (much more developed). Self-control as a muscle.

### Connections to the life-course

* Hirschi/Gottfredson vs. Moffit -> Hirschi really believes low social-control is socially caused whereas Moffit believes it's genetic. Both believe it's pretty stable. Both believe parents and schools play a big role. Another difference is Moffit believes you're baked by ages 2-3 and Hirschi/Gottfredson think it's by age 8-10. Gottfredson more receptive to the genetic stuff.
