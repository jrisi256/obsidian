## Outline of Labeling Theory

### Thesis Statement of Lemert’s Labeling/Symbolic Interactionist Theory

* Persons and groups have certain regularities of behavior, but there is differentiation and variation in the behavior. Some behavior is far from the average or norm, or it isn’t within the normal bounds of variation. This type of behavior elicits a response from society: *positive*, *indifferent*, or *negative*. The societal response will often reinforce the deviant behavior (for better or for worse) causing the individual to incorporate the deviancy as a part of their identity. In conclusion, the causes of deviancy aren’t limited to purported personal and structural factors. Societal response meant to discourage the deviant behavior (in the negative case) will end up perpetuating the deviant behavior.
    
	- It’s hard to say definitively in a case-by-case fashion how the society’s response to an individual’s deviant behavior will cause the individual to react. Their biology, personality (which is built up structurally), and demographic make-up set limits for the person to internally or symbolically interpret the societal response.
    
	- What is a norm? Limits to the variation in a given behavior held in common and recognized in retrospect by members of the shared group. Lemert is claiming norms are most deeply felt when broken, and people can look back to the norm-breaking action retrospectively to point at how the breakage made clear the norm being violated.  

### How do individuals deviate from norms?

The same objective action can take on very different meanings depending on the context in which it occurs.
    
- **Individual**: Consider the forger who is forging a check so as to harm their boss in some way because they hold a grudge against their boss. In this case the criminal act very much originates from the individual. It can be considered an isolated event.
    
- **Situational**: Deviation which begins as a result of the function of the forces external to the person. For example, a person who is going hungry and has no other method to provide for themselves other than to steal. A special type of situational deviation is cumulative situational deviation. This refers to deviancy which results from the internal conflict that occurs within a person when different groups they participate in hold contradictory values, and they must choose to act according to only one set of those values.
    
- **Systematic**: When situational deviation is communicated causing groups to form, the deviation then becomes systematic. Just like any group, it will develop its own subculture with specific rules, values, norms, roles, moral, and social organization. It will also, like other groups, include some methods of acculturation and informal social control.  
      
### How does society react to negative deviation?
    
* **Tolerance Quotient**: A conceptual tool meant to represent how a society will react to a given negative deviation.

	- Depending on the *social visibility* of the crime (different types of crime are more/less seen, perceptible, detectable) in addition to how compulsively the community follows the norm (how strongly held is the norm) and in conjunction with many other factors, these variables will determine how willing the group is to tolerate the deviation.
    
	- On the other side, there is the fact of objective action e.g. how damaging is it and how often does it occur?
    
	- These two factors together form the tolerance quotient or ratio. When the ratio reaches 1, the group is likely to take collective action to do something about the deviant action.
    
- Societal response can then be:

	- Wholly integrative of the new behavior where the deviance is now taken to be a part of the normal variation in behavior.
    
	- Tacitly allow it while nominally disapproving of it. In this case, the tolerance quotient stabilizes before reaching 1 so no collective action is taken. One example of this response can be modern views in the USA concerning gambling. Many people see it as a vice but not enough to seriously curb it (although in some cases it has been). Other times the deviant behavior is too woven into the fabric of society to completely remove (see collusion and corruption between politicians and business leaders).
    
	- Wholly disapproves of the action and works to stop the behavior as much as possible. This brings us to our next point.  
      
### Primary and Secondary Deviation

This will explain how the societal response and individual deviancy interact.
    
- **Primary Deviation**: The original cause of a deviant behavior. The original reason someone becomes an alcoholic, for example, are many and myriad. Their wife died, they lost their job, or they go out and party with friends too much.
    
- If their deviant action becomes repetitive, is highly visible, and engenders a strong negative societal reaction, the person will undergo an internal reorganization of themselves. A new role might be adopted where those tendencies which were once deviant are now more socially acceptable.
    
- **Secondary Deviation**: However they may also adopt a new role where the deviancy is a core part of their identity. Thus the person begins to employ their deviant behavior (and their roles created around this behavior) as a defense to the problems caused by society’s reaction.
    
	- Specifically, the social penalties and stigmatization of the individual blocks them from fulfilling their goals and aspirations, and it also blocks them from fully participating in society to the extent they would like. They reorganize themselves so as to be able to fulfill their goals through their deviancy, or they may even change their goals to fit their new deviant status.
    
	- It should be noted people find some benefit from the deviant behavior which is why they continue to engage in it despite the obvious social penalties it incurs. They have turned to the deviancy systematically because society has blocked them being able to do otherwise.

## Notes from CRIM512 Class

* Big emphasis on social control and the importance of understanding what it means. **Big three**: social control, social change, stratification -> how is social order possible?
	* **Pointing out that views on social control don't consider the byproducts of social control, AND they also don't consider social control is negotiated.** Counterpoint to utility-maximization model of economics (society isn't solely coercive and man isn't solely responding to incentives based on fear and self-interest).
	  
* Differentiation (broader view of stratification, how do we divide up people particularly in unequal ways, deviance is being different and identified as being different) -> what are the implications of being singled out as such? and individuation (we have a "social" personality as well as, internal/external limits, how we internalize the label from society).
  
* Organization of self-conceptions, aspirations, attitudes -> personality -> our choices then become constrained or bounded by our internal limits on what is and isn't possible.
  
* Most unique aspect of Lemert -> When we theorize and do research on crime, we study the deviant. "I have come to the conclusion, the social audience is the object we should be studying." -> this is because the society defines what is deviant and who will be defined as deviant. #quote 
  
* What's the effect of societal labeling on the deviant? -> Negative consequences and how does it affect the conception of self?

* **[[Secondary Deviance]]** -> on a continuum, life organized around deviance as it relates to your own self-conception which is predicated on the societal response to your deviant acts. Origins of subcultures comes from labeling/stigmatization as groups of people come together who are similarly labelled.

* **Power** plays an important role in dictating the laws and definition of deviancy (more Quinney than Lemert), but there is more to it than that. It's negotiated.
* **Process** -> Look at the process! Which involves interaction of individuals with each other and groups particularly with the agencies doing the labeling. Primary and secondary deviance are processual. It's stage-based and change-based. The early/original causes may not be the sustaining causes.

* Leads to exploitation of deviants particularly by agencies (juvenile justice, although his official assessment of the CA system was not too harsh or off-base).

* Choice, assessing risk -> You can run up your credit card bill or borrow money from a friend. You choose some risks which don't work out, and then you're in deeper -> the system imposes this on you and creates the risk (lose your driver's license) -> follow whole new set of rules (which would normally be allowed).

* [[symbolic interactionism]] -> What meaning do you assign to things? How do we interpret the meaning of what others are saying to us? And doing to us? How much room is there for negotiation of meaning?

* Part of labeling also involves sense of injustice and unfairness -> "I've done my time, and I'm still being punished." -> collateral, networked consequences almost (Sam's parents/grandparents stop talking to him) -> your life is affected by the deviant label in many, enduring ways -> secondary deviance.

* [[Social constructionism]] -> Comes from interactionist perspective, we, as a society, come to determine what the problems of society are and how serious of an issue is it -> [[beckerOutsidersStudiesSociology1963]] & moral entrepreneurs, lawmaking and how we come to define laws and the problems they're supposed to solve -> early causes vs. sustaining causes (internal and external limits are changing) -> focused on processual, internal/external limits, but not so much labeling/secondary deviation? -> going back to Lemert.
  
* Positive sides to labeling concerning deviant identity? -> Provides you a niche, can help gain some self-acceptance, access to material resources in some cases -> also positive deviants (athletes).
  
* Normalization -> Why are some acts identified as deviant but not others? The social audience accepts some actions but others don't. "Boys will be boys". Social audience is also quite variable and worthy of study.

* Questions:
	* Does labelling go too far with things like mental illness? How do we differentiate between our response and the objective behavior of the person
	* How does believing in something vs. not believing in something interact with the physiological and biological limits of the individual? At what point does the label become too limiting in the amount of choices available to the individual?
	* Things like ADHD and autism become quite tricky.
		* "The Making of the Blind Man", how blind are blind people? Blind people can be made to believe they're more blind than they actually are or on the other hand, we stigmatize blind people so much we don't realize how capable and independent they can be.
	* How much of labeling theory is also an implicit moral theory? Despite Lemert advocating for a more objective, scientific approach.
