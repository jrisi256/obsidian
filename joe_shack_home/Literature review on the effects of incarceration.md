## Effects on the focal individual

### Mechanisms
* Incarceration is stigmatizing. --> See [[schwartzTwoStudiesLegal1962]], [[pagerMarkCriminalRecord2003]], [[aganBanBoxCriminal2018]], [[kaiserRevealingHiddenSentence2016]].
 * **Incarceration erodes job skills**. --> Time spent out of employment prevents the acquisition of skills which they otherwise might have attained. Behaviors learned in prison are counterproductive for finding gainful employment outside of prison.
 * **Incarceration erodes social networks**. --> Connections to stable employers and family worsen, ties to gangs strengthen, the size of one's social networks and the number of weak ties is much smaller. See [[haganSocialEmbeddednessCrime1993]].
	 * Investigate Hagan further on how concentrations of poverty and joblessness are criminogenic.

* From the life-course perspective -> incarceration knives off development opportunities and prevents juveniles from experiencing important milestones in their development. See [[laubTurningPointsLife1993]] and [[sampsonCrimeMakingPathways1993]].
* Irwin and Austin 1997 -> Anti-social practices learned in prison.
* Parenti 1999 -> Institutional trauma.
### Labor and earnings
* [[garinImpactIncarcerationEmployment2024]] --> Negative short-term effects (2 - 3 years, on average, for a 12-month incarceration sentence) on the likelihood of being employed and on earnings. Affects cumulative lifetime earnings but earnings and labor mark attachment recover relatively quickly to match control group. The problem is that: 1) control group members also had very poor employment prospects meaning this group is just, in general, has poor labor market attachment, and 2) the control group was likely themselves to experience at some point in the future an incarceration spell.
* [[westernImpactIncarcerationWage2002]] --> Finds incarceration leads to slower wage growth.
* [[westernLaborMarketConsequences2001]] --> Review paper. Negative consequences on job market attachment are likely, but it is unclear whether or not incarceration is the driving causal force.
	* "Whereas the aggregate effects of the penal system on economic inequality are possibly very large, causal inference about the effect of imprisonment on labor market performance is difficult... Incarceration may not be undermining the economic opportunities of ex-inmates; it may simply be officially earmarking severely disadvantaged men who would otherwise have poor job prospects..."
### Health

### Marriage formation

### Social network and tie formation

### Future crime involvement

## Family effects

### Increased residential mobility and housing instability

### Less earning potential and strained familial financial resources

### Less adult supervision of children
* Worse educational outcomes.
* Worse behavioral/delinquency outcomes.

### Strained social network and social capital
* Time devoted to caring for the incarcerated individual (both while incarcerated and after incarceration).

## Neighborhood effects
### Public safety
* Incapacitation can decrease violence in neighborhoods but depends on the type and scale of incarceration (i.e, too much is likely to be bad and if only low-level offenders are being incarcerated than it's likely to have more negative outcomes in the medium to long term).
* Most evidence suggests the crime-inhibiting effects of incarceration largely come from incapacitation. If anything, incarceration is likely slightly criminogenic post-release.
### Legal cynicism

### Less economic activity and less business formation

### Spillover effects onto other residents
- Increased strain and inhibited social network formation (less social capital).
- Less collective efficacy.
- Maternal health, teenage pregnancy, childhood health, general health.
- School achievement.

Criminal justice contact more generally:
* Dobbie et al. 2018. -> pretrial detention worsens labor market outcomes.
* Mueller Smith and Schnepel 2021 show that felony diversions reduces future offending and increases future earnings.

Employment
* Kling 2006 --> Consistent.
* Loeffler 2013
* Mueller Smith 2015 --> Very different results. Very different design.
* Harding et al. 2018 --> Slightly different results.

Reoffending
* Norris et al. 2021 (Kamat et al. 2023 ?)
* Rose and Shem-Tov 2021.
