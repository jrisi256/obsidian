## Notes

### Introduction
During imprisonment, probation, and other penal supervision, offenders are subject to myriad restrictions on their civil, political, and social rights including limited speech, religious exercise, privacy, and spousal and parental rights. Can be excluded from occupations and welfare and from living in certain locations. These forms of extra-criminal sentencing make up the part of the offender’s punishment hidden from public and professional view -> All punishments the law imposes as a direct result of criminal status but not as a part of a formally recognized judge-imposed sentence.

Punishments must be made transparent from them to serve their purposes otherwise the legitimacy of the punishment (and its purposes) are called into question. The solution is to reveal the hidden sentence -> draws upon the National Inventory of the Collateral Consequences of Conviction (NICCC), a dataset of all codified, post-release hidden sentences across the USA.
### Part 1 - Overview of Hidden Sentences.

Difference from visible sentences is that they’re imposed by a process external to the criminal law or by a decision maker other than a sentencing judge -> Because of this they’ve been artificially separated from formally recognized sentences and obscured/ignored to varying degrees in public and professional knowledge. Additionally hidden sentences blend across categories of offender (penalties which accrue during imprisonment vs. probation vs. after release).

Categories of laws (tens of thousands of them across the states) -> business licenses, education, employment, family/domestic, government benefits/loans/grants, housing, voting rights, occupational and professional licensing, firearm possession, residency restrictions.  

### Part 2 - Defining Features of the Hidden Sentence

How are hidden sentences different from the collateral consequences of offenders’ rights movements? For starters, hidden punishments are purposeful. They are meant to further punish people who are convicted. They aren’t collateral (which implies accidental). Hidden sentences can be applied throughout many different stages of the criminal justice process: after arrest, during pre-trial proceedings, during incarceration, during probation/parole, after release into the community. Nearly 80% of sentences are permanent or have unspecified end dates.

These hidden sentences ostracize and segregate offenders. Cut them off from reintegration, live in low-income areas which are likely to have higher proportions of offenders. Second-class citizens.

Footnote 128 is very interesting in how it considers all Americans who may be indirectly impacted by hidden sentences (family, roommates, friends, coworkers). Feasibly all Americans could be in some way affected by them. The scale of the penal system is shockingly larger than previously imagined. It has become a core American institution.

Consequences which would be truly collateral would be ones not enacted by law (social ostracization, although it could be argued they aren’t really collateral since people purposely do these things as well). Furthermore collateral consequences implies hidden sentences aren’t punishment themselves. Yet they’re just as punitive as visible sentences.

Long digression about what constitutes punishment. Punishment requires intent but not motive, effectiveness, motive, magnitude of injury, or perception/response of the punished person. A gas tax of $2 per gallon might be excessive but not a punishment. A ten dollar fine in response to murder would be a punishment but maybe not proportional -> “Words matter. Anyone who studies the text of the law ought to know that it has real effects on judges’ interpretations and real-world impressions.”

### Part 3 - The Legal Production of Hiddenness

Four characteristics that obscure hidden sentences in contemporary legal doctrine:

1. **Scope**: Quantity of breadth of these laws. Subject to potentially hundreds of hidden sentences.
2. **Dispersion**: Size of a body law alone doesn’t make it totally unmanageable (see tax code). However it is dispersed among many different types of law (housing, welfare, etc.).
3. **Variability**: Fluctuate greatly in their consequences, when they’re enacted, who enacts them, for how long, what acts are subject to which consequences.
4. **Inconspicuousness**: The law doesn’t require penal officials and employees to know about, actively consider, or even provide notice of hidden sentences. Sentencing guidelines don’t incorporate them.

### Part 4 - Detrimental Effects of Hidden Sentencing

Transparency is necessary for the purposes of punishment to take effect (retribution, rehabilitation, deterrence, incapacitation). Otherwise the person is unsure what they’re being punished for, why, and for how long. Creates feelings of resentment. Or in the case of something like deterrence, how can it deter people if they don’t know about it?

Transparency is also necessary for the democratic process.

### Part 5 - Conclusion and Policy

1. Require public notice and active judicial consideration. Pamphlets, mailings, and other such mechanisms could be used to broadly educate offenders as to what punishment awaits them.
2. Reform the terminology so as to recognize that hidden sentences are punishment and purposeful.
3. Create extra-criminal sentencing sections within criminal codes.
4. Adjust legal education.
5. Modify judicial sentencing procedures.

The article kind of waffles back and forth a little bit here about the sheer volume of punishments people are subject to. It seems like the real issue we should be tackling. Making them more transparent is important, but they don’t really mention it.
