## Abstract

Proactive policing, the strategic targeting of people or places to prevent crimes, is a well-studied tactic that is ubiquitous in modern law enforcement. A 2017 National Academies of Sciences report reviewed existing literature, entrenched in deterrence theory, and found evidence that proactive policing strategies can reduce crime. The existing literature, however, does not explore what the short and long-term effects of police contact are for young people who are subjected to high rates of contact with law enforcement as a result of proactive policing. Using four waves of longitudinal survey data from a sample of predominantly black and Latino boys in ninth and tenth grades, we find that adolescent boys who are stopped by police report more frequent engagement in delinquent behavior 6, 12, and 18 months later, independent of prior delinquency, a finding that is consistent with labeling and life course theories. We also find that psychological distress partially mediates this relationship, consistent with the often stated, but rarely measured, mechanism for adolescent criminality hypothesized by general strain theory. These findings advance the scientific understanding of crime and adolescent development while also raising policy questions about the efficacy of routine police stops of black and Latino youth. Police stops predict decrements in adolescentsâ€™ psychological well-being and may unintentionally increase their engagement in criminal behavior.

## My notes

### Background

* Research on proactive policing has not focused on the long-term outcomes of these strategies. Nor have they focused on how it affects individuals and communities.
  
* What is the effect of police contact on criminal delinquency of Black and Latino boys?
  
* Four waves of longitudinal data demonstrate that contact with law enforcement is associated with increase in black and Latino adolescent boy's self-reported criminal behavior 6, 12, and 18 months later.

* Results are partially mediated by psychological distress.
  
* The younger the age of first contact, the stronger the results.
  
* Age and prior delinquent behavior did not moderate the results.

* Delinquent behavior did not predict a police stop 6 months later in the next wave. Boys who engaged in delinquency were just as likely at those who did not to be stopped by the police. #question They argue this goes against deterrence theory, but I fail to see how, exactly.

### Data and Methods

* Boys participated during their high school years.
* 645 boys.
* Recruited from 6 public high schools in high-intensity policing neighborhoods in a large city in the southern USA.
* First surveyed in September 2013. Surveys re-administered every 6 months until spring 2015.
* Used [[Structural equation modeling]] to model all the pathways cross-sectionally and temporally and to do mediation analysis.

**Independent Variables**

* Police stops -> based on survey responses.
* Psychological distress -> measured as a latent variable using [[multigroup confirmatory factor analysis]].
* Control variables -> age, race, county of birth, school, employed, parent-household characteristics, school fixed effects, negative affect, stereotype threat, perceived procedural justice, academic achievement, and police stops while driving.

**Dependent Variables**

* Self-reported delinquency.
