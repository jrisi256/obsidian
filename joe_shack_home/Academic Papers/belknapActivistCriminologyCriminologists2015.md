## Abstract

Similar to many criminologists, my interest in pursuing this career was driven by a desire to improve responses to injustices, on both small and large scales. I believe that among criminologists, this dedication to effect changes in social and legal justice disproportionately drives those of us historically kept out of the academy due to our race, gender, class, sexual identity, and/or other marginalizations. Fortunately, there is a growing diversity among criminologists and this has had a powerful impact on expanding the scope and depth of the field. At the same time, I am concerned that academic training and university climates frequently work against our commitment to advancing social and legal justice changes, what I refer to as “criminology activism.” This address is a call to action, stressing criminologists’ responsibility to advocate for social and legal justice on small and large scales. Numerous types of criminology activism are identified (e.g., in research, service, and teaching), including the requisite to continue diversifying the representation of criminologists.

## My notes

"Criminologists should be more active in addressing these harmful and unjust patterns for numerous reasons, principally, research clearly documenting that the availability of quality education, health care, and other forms of social services (including professional responses to victims) are key to successfully safeguarding against offending and incarceration." #quote 

"If criminologists are unwilling to become more committed to activism and dedicated to changing these practices and policies, we can expect continuing and alarming ineffectiveness in deterring offending and incarceration." #quote

As criminologists, we have a heightened responsibility for activism due to the immense privileges afforded to us as academics and researchers housed within the university system.

Acts of resistance can be small and everyday or large and grand in which attempts are made to change our institutions.

What is activist criminology? Criminologists engaging in social and/or legal justice at the individual, organizational, and policy levels which goes beyond typical research, teaching, and service.

* People from marginalized backgrounds and people from different disciplinary backgrounds are no more or less likely than mainstream social scientists to biased and un-objective. Indeed, objectivity can often be code for disallowing marginalized voices to speak.
	* In ethnographic work, it is often less useful (and perhaps less humane) to remain objective.

Convict criminology -> new thing. New perspectives which can help in the theorizing process.
* Attacks on their integrity as researchers because they are too implicated in the research is cruel and wrong.

The academy does not reward activism and, in fact, can view it as a detriment to your objectivity as a scholar.

### Activist criminology

#### Service

One particularly important job we should do is broaden the diversity of criminologists to more accurately reflect our area of study -> field is dominated by straight, white men.
	* This is hard work and requires constant attention be paid to the processes in place for hiring, promotion, and accepting students. Are the best practices to mitigate bias in place?

### Teaching

* Inside-out teaching where courses are taught to a blended class of current prisoners and college students sometimes in a prison/jail setting.
  
* Can also teach about things like restorative justice and have college students *mentor* prisoner students.

#### Research

Where science speaks truth to political power -> identifying the possibilities and limitations of approaches like [[harm reduction]].

Advocacy research -> ".... conduct legitimate studies of practices that appear, to the advocate/researcher, to be immoral, inadvisable, or against the best interests of a class of people." The aim is to use data in harm prevention efforts and motivate/impact policy.

Activist research also encompasses research which assists victims and offenders and can educate workers such as victim advocates or the police, for example.

* Help sample members feel counted and like they're contributing to something important.
  
* Can help agencies collect better and more meaningful data.
  
* Report the results back to the sample members.
