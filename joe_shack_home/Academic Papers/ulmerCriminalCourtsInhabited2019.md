## Abstract

An [[inhabited institutions]] perspective views institutions from the bottom up, as “inhabited” by individual and organizational actors who have agency, rather than as static, top-down structures. Criminal justice structures and policies, such as those that govern courts and their sentencing decisions, are dependent on court participants. From this perspective, several conclusions emerge. First, theory and methods in the study of courts and sentencing are out of balance: theories emphasize interpretation, culture, and processes, while empirical inquiries focus largely on statistical studies of aggregates and outcomes. Second, the inhabited institutions perspective blurs the lines between the discretions of specific participants such as prosecutors and judges. Rather than attempt to parse the discretion of individual actors, we should study the interactions that jointly produce discretionary decisions. Third, we should focus on specific organizational mechanisms that produce both uniformity and variation between courts. Finally, variation between courts in sentencing practices should be understood not as a nuisance in top-down imposition of sentencing policies, but as a valuable but underappreciated source of policy feedback and learning.

## My notes

### Inhabited Institutions

[[Bordieu]] and fields -> Individual and collective actors engage in mutually organized striving toward mutually recognized goals and develop distinctive rules and practices. Court systems are institutional fields.

How similar are organizations within the same field? Known as [[organizational isomorphism]]. Coercive isomorphism (forced compliance by authorities). Normative isomorphism (conformity motivated by institutionalized norms, behavioral expectations, and their perceived legitimacy). Mimetic isomorphism (conformity through routine application of shared cultural and cognitive lenses).
### Organizational Variation

The same institutional rules can result in differences in organizational adherence.

**Organizational Coupling**
    
- The degree of correspondence between formal institutional norms or rules and organizational practice. “Macro myths” are supposed to guide their practice (equality and uniformity before the law, due process) but exceptions emerge due to clashes in organizational goals and interests. This results in localized adaptations and selective circumvention of formalized rules.
    
- Also refers to connection between criminal justice organizations or stages (coupling between police and prosecutors or courts and local politicians).
    
- Inhabited institutions and [[processual orders]] -> In light of selective circumvention, scholars argue we should view institutions as inhabited by actors with agency and the actors' sense-making drives organizational functioning. The effect of institutional rules or policies on local practices are empirically indeterminate.
    
	- The **processual order** describes the mechanism by which local organizations adapt to and transform higher-order norms. It’s the informal social order which emerges from strategic interactions between organizational participants. It involves negotiation, persuasion, manipulation, education, threats, coercion, etc. Norms and rules change through interaction processes. Rules do not simply come about through fiat and remain static. Forms agreed upon arrangements to problems caused or not covered by the formal rules and remain so until rendered inadequate by new situations. Of course not everyone has equal power in these arrangements.

### Court Communities are Inhabited Institutions

- Court community model is a popular lens for viewing contextual and local court variation. Courts are distinctive processual orders based on participants’ shared workplace and interdependent working relations. These interactions develop distinctive social orders which produce local organizational cultures which shape formal and informal case processing and sentencing norms. “Going rates”. Also “plea agendas” or what’s considered key bargaining chips in a plea. As described above, they’re developed through sedimented outcomes. Form a stock of knowledge to be relied upon until rendered inadequate by new circumstances.
    
- Of course there is coercion from above (sentencing guidelines and mandatory minimums) → but they interpret them in locally distinctive ways leading to variation in compliance → courts are governed by institutional rules and laws but are inhabited by work group actors with agency and their own informal norms.
    
- [[focal concerns of courtroom actors]] is one way to interpret the substantive rationality goals of individuals within the courtroom workgroup.
    
### Empirical Issues

- **The influence of individual work group members** -> How do individual work group members' characteristics shape their actions? E.g. their race, age, gender, experience, political ideology. And then how they manifest in all the micro-decisions made in a courtroom: Prosecutors more/less likely to dismiss charges? Judge decision-making? Departures from guidelines? Private vs. public defenders? How do they all interact?
    
- **Murder sentencing** -> How do local courtroom contexts play out in regards to murder trials? Do they still display variation? Some preliminary research suggests yes you will still see variation even within the same state by county. Large differences between counties in the likelihood of death penalty motions being filed. County characteristics matter as well.
    
- **Guideline Conformity and Deviation** -> Long-scale studies suggest some reductions in disparity, they became embedded and relatively central in local courts’ cultures, helped establish going rates so to speak, and seemed to produce changes in sentencing in line with what legislators wanted.

	- But of course evidence as well of court community variation in conformity to the guidelines.
    
	- Federal district courts are also their own beasts with their own guidelines having been revised from very strict and hated to now very advisory. But can be used to see when and where judges disagree with the guidelines and depart from them. Also look at the roles prosecutors play in the departure (caseloads and racial composition of their district are important factors). So even though they’re advisory, they’re still influential and followed more than not (depends a lot on how legitimately the judge views them).
    
- **Native Americans and Federal Justice** -> Federal government has federal criminal jurisdiction over 15 categories of crime. However depending on the jurisdiction, they can take relatively hands-on or hands-off approaches. Hands-on approaches means aggressive enforcement of the law. Hands-off might mean under-enforcement but also the development of sovereign tribal institutions.

### Implications for Research

- **Study what inhabitants think and do**. Our theories are at odds with our data and methods. We need more multi-method approaches.
    
- **Parsing specific actors’ discretion is illusionary**. “Sentences result not simply from the decisions of individual judges and prosecutors but also from interactions between judges and prosecutors.” We cannot isolate the discretion of this or that actor. Push back against economics-oriented modeling which isolates this person’s discretion. There are no unilateral actions.
    
- **Study mechanisms which produce court isomorphism and variation**. What produces court similarities but also differences? How do formal and informal norms spread? How do the different types of isomorphism take hold?
    
- **Policy feedback and institutional learning**. How do courtroom policies evolve and learn? How can legislatures incorporate different forms of data to understand how their guidelines are working? Particularly around departures. More research needed around the hidden processes of prosecutorial discretion. It isn’t an inherent good or bad that actors are/aren’t following the guidelines. Fieldwide isomorphism isn’t inherently good or beneficial and variation isn’t inherently bad. Local variation may be more efficient or fairer.
