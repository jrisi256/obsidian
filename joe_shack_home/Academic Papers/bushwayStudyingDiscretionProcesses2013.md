## Abstract

This paper presents a typology of discretion that differs from the standard typology of discretion in the legal literature: [[Type A Discretion]], which is the generally recognized discretion of individual actors to make decisions within a set of laws and rules, and [[Type B Discretion]], which is the crafting of laws and setting of rules in the first place. An analysis using aggregate data from 1992 to 2002 points to the prosecution stage as the primary source of Type A discretion that contributed to the massive increase in incarceration during this period. To understand how this could happen, this paper argues that actions need to be linked to outcomes. We identify three key outcomes of the sanctioning process—crime control, justice (guilt/innocence), racial disparity (fairness)—that deserve more attention from social scientists.

## My notes

#paper_idea -> important paper to consider in light of my dissertation.

### Definitions

* **Type A Discretion** -> Discretion of individual actors to make decisions within a set of laws and rules. May be also called *weak* discretion wherein decision-makers have to make decisions and interpretations based on (inherently) imprecise rules. Analysis of data points to the prosecution stage as the primary source of Type A discretion which contributed to mass incarceration.
  
* **Type B Discretion** -> Crafting of laws and setting of rules in the first place. This deserves more study.

Criminal Justice *System*

* **Incarceration Rate** -> Proportion of convicted persons incarcerated.
* **Proportion of the population incarcerated** -> Percentage of the population in prison or jail.
* Crime rate → rate at which offenses result in arrest → rate at which arrests result in convictions → rate at which convictions end in incarceration → average term of incarceration.

Provides insight into the changes in discretion by police, prosecutors, judges, and legislators. Steady-state assumption about how all these flow into one another and can yield final variables of interest. But some issues with this model (lags i.e. when crime rates are falling people recently entering prison are from smaller pools of offenders than were those currently incarcerated). Also parole and probation violations.
### Current Study  

Current study examines 1992 - 2002 to get a sense of the respective contributions police, prosecutors, judges, and legislators had on the increase in the incarceration rate. Crime decline, prison population increased substantially, happened due to tougher sanctions, larger pools of offenders → police and prosecutors made no attempts to adjust by reducing arrest and conviction rates.

Analyzing discretion -> look to other fields (portfolio management) → How well do the rules work when followed as predicted? What *should* happen under the *preferred* system. Discretion cannot be evaluated then without first figuring out what goals are to be achieved. When goals aren’t agreed upon, it’s easier to focus on the process. But research needs to start investigating what it is the criminal justice system is trying to achieve → System has goals, evaluate impact of formal rules on achieving those goals (Type B), we can then see how Type A helps or hinders accomplishment of the goals.

### Research Questions

**Reducing Disparity** → Do guidelines reduce disparity? Some scholars argue they do. These authors claim no. Disparities seem largely the same before and after. Larger problem is these analyses are focused on conviction data. We need system-wide data. Can create bench marking models and counterfactual worlds to see how real-world disparities are different from hypothesized, idealized alternatives. Can look at guidelines/statutes themselves as sources of disparity. Crack vs. cocaine.

**Crime** → Another goal of sentencing. Laws are intended to reduce crime. Usually do before/after analyses on crime data. Causal power is limited, challenging to find counterfactuals. Another approach is to use longitudinal data (people’s drinking behavior before/after they become of legal age to drink). Individual-level data is very important, linking sentencing data to data on criminal behavior. We need to be creating theoretical models which account for what should be happening and then comparing to this theoretical model rather than the null.

**Justice** → Articles on discretion rarely consider the impacts of rules and process on errors in the deciding of who is decided to be innocent or guilty. We rely on probabilistic rules of conviction, this means there will be natural variation. Usually a tradeoff between false positives and false negatives (should be studying baseline levels and tradeoffs between these errors). Heated discussion of the costs of the types of error.

**Abuses of Type A** -> Corruption and brutality for police. Lack of transparency around prosecutor practices. So one solution is more transparency. We need individual identifiable data too. How to distinguish between actions of the individual and actions of the group as prescribed by rules? One paper uses statistical methods to benchmark standard police stopping behavior for comparison purposes to identify outliers. Issues around researchers being beholden to the system to obtain the data.

* Can also use random assignment of cases to identify impact of individual actors on subsequent outcomes → however using judges as instrumental variables is hard because the variation itself isn’t modeled. Different actors are doing different things which makes it hard to identify the mechanisms by which sentences are handed down. Unless you can model the decision-making process, you won’t be able to identify the treatment impact of sentence length on subsequent behavior.
  
* Modeling decision-making behavior can also be useful for finding abuses when there is strong enough deviation from the model.

### Future Research

Discretion isn’t inherently good or bad. We should analyze the ability of policy-makers at all levels to affect outcomes. Type B style discretion needs to be evaluated on all people being acted on by the system. Showing guidelines reduce disparity at conviction is insufficient to prove the point. Simulate what should have happened vs. what did happen (amount of Type A discretion available).

Type A → Continue to research individual discretion. Surveys. Administrative data. Use different alternative models as the basis of comparison (e.g. use sentencing guidelines as what judges deviate from, not the null). Models of individual decision-making. Don’t limit analysis to data currently available! It’s like looking for your lost keys only where there is light.

Authors argue for further research into prosecutorial discretion. Also test for interactions among actors.

Need individual identifiable data → find good and bad actors. Exogenous variation. Find differences in behavior based on differences in philosophy and experience → also build normative models of what policy makers should do given how much discretion individual actors appear to be displaying and how far it deviates from optimal.
