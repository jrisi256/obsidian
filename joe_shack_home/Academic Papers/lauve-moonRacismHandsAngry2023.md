## Abstract

Previous research suggests an [[angry God image]] is a narrative schema predicting support for more punitive forms of criminal justice. However, this research has not explored the possibility that racialization may impact one's God image. We perform [[Logistic regression]] on Wave V of the [[Baylor Religion Survey]] to examine the correlation between an angry God image and the belief that police shoot Blacks more often because Blacks are more violent than Whites (a context-specific form of cultural racism). Engaging critical insights from intersectionality theory, we also interact angry God image with both racialized identity and racialized religious tradition. Results suggest that the angry God schema is associated with this form of cultural racism for White people generally as well as White Evangelicals, yet for Black Protestants, belief in an angry God is associated with resistance against this type of cultural racism.

## My notes

### What is the research question?

* Previous research has demonstrated that the *intersectionality* of race and religion is important for understanding beliefs around racialized police violence.
* How does one's view of God impact one's views on racialized police violence?
* How does one's race impact one's view of God?
  
* One's view of God provides insight into one's inner moral beliefs as well one's behaviors. E.g., belief in an angry God is associated with more punitive criminal justice attitudes.
* [[Colorblind racism]] -> Functions on coded language and invisible processes which perpetuate social institutions designed to reproduce White supremacy. "... powerful alternative explanations have been developed to exculpate the majority group from having to take responsibility for the status of people of color."
  
* **Hypothesis** -> For White respondents, an angry God narrative fits with views that individuals are solely responsible for their own fate (which is a key mechanism of colorblind racism). Angry God beliefs are also connected with more punitive CJ views, thus White individuals may see state violence as legitimate reactions to a highly violent minority group.
* **Vs. Black respondents** -> Association between angry God and punitive justice may be different due to a greater awareness of structural disadvantage and differing views on the legitimacy of state violence.
	* Differing levels of acceptance of colorblind racism (focus on individual vs. structural factors) shape individual's views of God and also one's views on the legitimacy of state violence. White religious institutions are much more accepting of colorblind racism and individualizing. **Priestly view of Angry God** (accept his authority) vs. **Prophetic view of God** (he will save us) so the question of an *angry God* hides heterogeneity in how people actually view God.
	  
* **H1** -> As a person’s image of God as angry increases, White respondents will have higher probability of adhering to the frame that the violence of Black persons is to blame for the disproportionate police shootings of Black persons.
* **H2** -> Among Black respondents generally, the association between angry God and adherence to the frame that the violence of Black persons is to blame for the disproportionate police shootings of Black persons will operate differently compared to White persons.
* **H3** -> As a person’s image of God as angry increases, respondents in the historically White traditions (White Evangelical, White Mainline, and White Catholic) will have higher probability of adhering to the frame that the violence of Black persons is to blame for the disproportionate police shootings of Black persons.
* **H4** -> As a person’s image of God as angry increases, respondents in Black Protestant denominations will have lower probability of adhering to the frame that the violence of Black persons is to blame for the disproportionate police shootings of Black persons compared to respondents in the White Evangelical tradition.

Basically, as someone's view of God as angry increases in strength of belief, White respondents will be more likely to view Black people as responsible for police violence while Black respondents will be less likely.
### How do you propose to answer it?

* Data comes from the Baylor Religion Survey.
* **Dependent variable** -> "... police officers in the United States shoot Blacks more often because they are more violent than Whites..." 4-point [[Likert scale]]. Collapsed into a two-point scale.
* **Independent variable** -> One's image of an angry God. Built on five questions which are added up on a 0-15 ordinal scale where lower values represent less of a belief in an angry God.
	* Only consider Black and White respondents.
	* Also consider religious affiliation.
	* Religious attendance, political orientation, gender, educational attainment, income, and age.
* Use logistic regression modeling procedures. [[Ordinal logistic regression]] failed the [[parallel lines assumption]].
### What do you find?

* **Table 2** -> Descriptively we see differences in the dependent variable between White and Black respondents.
	* Not much variation among White respondents by religious affiliation.
	* More variation among Black respondents by religious affiliation.

* **Table 3**
	* The more you view God as angry, the more likely you are to view Black people as responsible for police brutality.
	* Black respondents were less likely.
	* The more you attended religious services, the less likely you were.
	* Women were less likely.
	* Age had no significant effects.
	* The more education one had, the less likely you were.
	* The more conservative one was, the more likely you were.
	* Income had no significant effects.
	* Small [[coefficient of determination]].
	* **Model 3** -> The interaction of angry God and Black produced statistically insignificant results, but the trend was negative suggesting that Black respondents, as their belief in an angry God increased, were less likely.
		* Angry God narrative appears influential among White respondents while for Black respondents their racial identity, itself, appeared to be more important.
	* **Model 5** -> Most complicated findings. White Evangelicals and Black Protestants mean different things when talking about an angry God.
		* Why only White Evangelicals and Black Protestants?
		* Argue the belief in the angry God is much more powerful in affecting the views of White Evangelicals compared to other religious, racial groupings. Unclear, though, why Evangelicals with lowest views of angry God are least likely to be supportive (noise or trend).
		* Black Protestants appear to view angry God in a prophetic way, liberating, sweeps away injustices. Why are Black Protestants without the view of an angry God most likely? Unclear -> uncritically accept colorblind racism without the counterpoint of liberation theology?

* Seemingly race-neutral beliefs (e.g., angry God) may interact with racial ideologies in ways which turn previously racially neutral beliefs into racially non-neutral beliefs.
