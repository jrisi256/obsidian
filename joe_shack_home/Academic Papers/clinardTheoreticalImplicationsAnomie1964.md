## My notes

### Durkheim

* [[Durkheim]] was interested how a society, such as his own in France, was able to maintain cohesion while having such a high degree of social differentiation. It would all tumble because social relationships would become too unstable without some external mechanism keeping it altogether, like the state.

* Three abnormal forms of [[division of labor]].
	* Forced division, where the distribution of occupations doesn't follow the distribution of talent.
	* Worker doesn't develop a sense of participation in a common enterprise.
	* The predominant one was one he termed anomie. Lack of integration between the many functions spawning out of cities. Fails to produce sufficiently effective contacts between members and fails to adequately regulate social relationships -> Anomie appears again in his study of suicide.
	  
* In sudden economic loss and gain, people are thrown out of adjustment (suicides spike when there's sudden loss and sudden gain). They no longer feel like they're getting anywhere in terms of what they desire. Men's appetite grows insatiable and there's a breakdown in norms controlling men. Thus suicide is not only an individual phenomenon but also a fact resulting from certain social organizations -> Degree of control/regulation by society, amount of group unity, and strength of ties binding people together. Other types of suicide as well.
  
* Durkheim's [[anomie]] is thus norm-lessness. Man's aspirations rise beyond all possibility of fulfillment. Discipline isn't imposed by society. Durkheim points out stable societies are ones in which definite goals help the individual to respect collective authority. Economic goals are more clearly defined and fall within the aspirations of the individual.

### Merton

* Merton reformulated Durkheim's view such that social structures exert a definite pressure upon certain persons in a society to engage in nonconforming rather than conforming conduct. He viewed behavior like crime as a normal response given a person's social situation. Just as normal as somebody conforming.
  
* Unlike Durkheim, Merton did not consider man's biological nature to be important. Merton felt that such things as man's "ambition to achieve unattainable goals" were also the result of social forces.
	* "The image of man as an untamed bundle of impulses looks more like a caricature rather than a portrait of man." #quote 
	  
* For Merton, the culture sets the goals. The social structure then emerges by setting norms on behavior to achieve those goals. Can be many goals (which clash with the means open to those who are socially disadvantaged). Goals are likely to affect means. Goals can become more important than means and vice versa. Equilibrium is achieved when individuals derive satisfaction from the means and the goals.
  
* For Merton, anomie is a breakdown between cultural goals and social norms wherein members of the group cannot act within those norms to achieve those goals. The distribution of deviant behavior will depend on the accessibility of legitimate means to secure the goals and how assimilated those goals and means are within the different strata of society. Not all those subject to pressure will become deviant.
  
* For Merton, deviancy cannot be explained by lack of opportunity or exaggerated emphasis on accumulation of wealth alone. But rather the egalitarian belief system in American society that everybody can achieve success, is the key ingredient.
  
* For Merton, the five adaptations one can take on to achieve culturally prescribed goals of success arise from strains in the social system. They can be assumed to have a degree of spontaneity behind them.
  
* Two types of deviant behavior: non-conforming and aberrant. Non-conformists announce their dissent publicly and challenges the legitimacy of the norms they reject. The aberrant hides their departure and acknowledges the legitimacy of the norms they violate.
  
* Innovators -> Delinquency and crime appear in the lower strata of society (more frequently), and this is a "normal" response to a situation where the cultural emphasis upon monetary success has been absorbed but where there is little access to conventional and legitimate means for becoming successful. Result in gradual reduction in efforts to use legitimate means and an increase in the use of more or less expedient illegitimate means. Of course, these pressures exert themselves on those at the top (just not as much as those at the bottom) and manifests as white collar crime.
  
* Merton in later essays claims not all deviant behavior can be explained by anomie.
  
* Some people also point out innovation is mostly dynamic and may serve to keep society healthy by creating healthier, newer institutions and norms.

### Extensions of Merton's ideas

* I skip over some of the less important extensions. But I should link here to [[clowardIllegitimateMeansAnomie1959]] (and Ohlin's) extension where they get at the idea of opportunity.

* Albert Cohen has an interesting adaptation where he says juvenile delinquent gang behavior is a product of groups solutions to the status problems, needs, and frustrations of the lower class in American society. Resent the imposition of middle class values onto them. Because so much of this delinquency is non-utilitarian in character, Merton's anomie cannot be a good explanation for this type of deviancy.
	* In his defense, Merton, again, claims anomie cannot explain all behavior and does not maintain deviant behavior is rational and calculated but emerges from acute pressures from a person's place in the social structure.
	  
* "... a taste for marijuana, disrespect for the usual customs, all of these may have a primary function of affirming, in the language of gesture and deed, that one is a certain kind of person... the point being the behavior need not be an adaptation to the insufficiency of other means. One may cultivate the behavior because it's significant to the role they wish to express." #quote

### Measuring anomie

* Some attempts have been made to measure anomie. At the structural level, it's associated particularly with a lack of home ownership. Anomia is also being measured by a scale developed by Leo Srole.

### Criticisms

* Lemert raises the criticism that it's difficult, and not at all assured, to identify a set of values that could be considered universal. Lemert believes *goals* grow out of the nature of associations in society. Lemert also further points out that our empirical data is too limited to say that deviancy is more limited to the lower classes vs. the upper classes. Also brings in his [[labeling theory]] ideas (why do some crimes cause reorganization of the self and not others).
  
* Lemert (also in conjunction with labeling) thinks social control also too frequently becomes a cause rather than an effect of delinquency. Active social control is a continuous process in which values are examined and decisions made as to which values should be of primary importance. Agencies of social control, like the police, are constantly determining what norms will be enforced and which will be disregarded. Thus social control isn't continuously applied on the same set of norms. Bringing into question how much of an explanation anomie really is.
	* "...the characteristics of addiction in any nation can best be predicted from the type of control policy in use in each country." #quote 
	  
* Another guy, Dunham, says something similar about trying to link something as abstract as anomie to something so specific as mental disorders.
  
* People who study drug addiction say the demographics of drug addiction are changing over time. Seems unlikely (and impossible to prove) it was anomie which animated both sets of behaviors. Also hard to prove anomie existed prior to the addiction -> Vast majority of people don't get addicted even in most destitute settings.
  
* Lindesmith and Gagnon point out that Merton's classification of drug addicts as "retreatists" isn't entirely true. Many are productive members of society. Who share the common frame of values, who have not abandoned the culturally shared symbols of success. Argue addiction is a cause of the failure rather than failure being a cause of the addiction. Also argue the use of drugs isn't deviant. It's all contextual.
