## Abstract

Comparative historical methods are used to explain the transformation of the U.S. penal order in the second half of the 20th century. The analysis of multiple state-level case studies and national-level narratives suggests that this transformation has three distinct, but interconnected, historical periods and reveals that the complex interaction between national and state-level politics and policy helps explain the growth in imprisonment between 1970 and 2001. Specifically, over time, national political competition, federal crime control policy, and federal court decisions helped create new state-level political innovation and special interest groups that compelled lawmakers to increasingly define the crime problem as a lack of punishment and to respond by putting more people in prison for longer periods of time. In turn, state-level developments facilitated increasingly radical crime control politics and policies at the national level that reflected historical traditions found in Sun Belt states.

## Highlighted Notes

### Introduction

How did mass incarceration grow so uniformly across the country given the intensely local nature of the criminal justice system?  

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1376&annotation=VHV5H39E) “Namely, if incarceration rates are first and foremost the result of decisions at the local level (arrests, prosecutions, and sentencing) and state level (sentencing policy, prison capacity), how is it that imprisonment grew in every state during roughly the same time period? The national character of the punitive turn is all the more puzzling given the diversity of regional and state histories, cultures, and political ideologies” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1376](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1383&annotation=GWBA3DKV) “In other words, what is needed is a theoretical framework that can explain both the consistent, persistent punitive shift and the variation in the extent and timing of that shift.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1383](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))

1) National political competition.
2) Federal crime control policy.
3) Federal court decisions.

All these things created state-level political innovation and special interest groups which saw crime as a result of a lack of punishment.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1377&annotation=4IVQ9AMN) “Specifically, we find that over time national political competition, federal crime control policy, and federal court decisions helped to create state-level political innovation and special interest groups that pushed lawmakers to increasingly define the crime problem as a lack of punishment and to choose policy solutions that put more people in prison for longer periods of time. In turn, state-level developments created new opportunities and resources for national and state politicians—with important consequences for changes to the approach to crime control.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1377](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P)) 
  
Analysis focuses on Sun Belt states which had attained growing influence on national politics. Their prominence influenced national politics to reflect their political and penal traditions (expanded use of incarceration and changing ideas about the fundamental purpose of prisons).  
  
Politicians were able to use criminal sanctions to accumulate political power.

### History

Before mass incarceration, criminal justice policy was marked by an emphasis on reform. However, this was intensely regional and racial.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1378&annotation=Y2L9CC8R) “According to the dominant historiography, penal sanctioning before 1970 was marked by a consensus that government agencies could and should reform individual offenders... ” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1378](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))

A new penal order emerged in the 1970s. This new order led to new actors having power to shape policy in the criminal justice system. The end result was uniquely high and racially disproportionate incarceration rates -> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1379&annotation=JXYVYMWL). Reforms today have to subscribe to this new penal order.

Given that for much of our time, incarceration rates were so comparatively low, this period of time needs explanation.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1379&annotation=9HCXW2GJ) “... purpose of prison is incapacitation and retribution, criminals are 'other' and not worthy of redemption, and that being labeled soft on crime is the ultimate political liability... ” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1379](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1379&annotation=IDF4J5SR) “It contains a specific 'penal field' where penal policies are shaped by politicians, law enforcement, and victims’ organizations rather than by judges, social workers, criminologists, or community organizations...  ” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1379](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))
  
* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1380&annotation=NUTRDYKT) “Even recent reforms in more lenient directions are being sold as economic imperatives... ” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1380](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1380&annotation=WEB4CFXU) “The low levels of incarceration in the recent past in the United States and in comparable democracies suggest that the contemporary penal order is not a given, but an extreme outcome that needs to be explained.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1380](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))

### Explaining the punitive turn

Some typical explanations fall short because they fail to explain why it only happened in the USA.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1380&annotation=P3TDUD2L) “... deindustrialization, the diffusion of risk, and the rise in crime” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1380](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P)) 

See [[garlandPenalityPenalState2013]] and [[savelsbergKnowledgeDominationCriminal1994]].

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1380&annotation=MBNN6U5Q) “Here comparative research and cross-national analyses of imprisonment rates suggest that the United States’ brand of federalism, with decentralized political and policy-making structures and weak political parties, obliges policy makers to bend toward populist demands” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1380](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P)).

The authors, here, argue it was a political calculation to gain power on the part of conservative parties -> [[pickettPublicOpinionCriminal2019]] may or may not disagree though since it does appear as if the population had become more punitive.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1381&annotation=PGJ6USZZ) “Contrary to explanations that point to penal populism, this scholarship points out that politicians’ rhetoric reshapes public opinion, which then reinforces politicians’ policy priorities.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1381](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))

However, we need to really understand what happened at the state-level since states are so different but mass incarceration happened everywhere. -> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1382&annotation=N8GKJR9Y)

#### How do events at the national level influence trends at the state level?

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1388&annotation=ZDTWYRRD) Media coverage of the President and federal government sets the boundaries of political debate at the state level.
  
* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1388&annotation=446U4XX5) “Second, federal policy mandates, federal funding, and administrative directives create new problems, ideas, and resources for state politicians, policy makers, bureaucrats, and interest groups.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1388](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P)) This creates opportunities for people to come in and work on their preferred solutions.
  
* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1388&annotation=2BPYTJHV) “And third, we find that federal court behavior, and specifically their willingness to regulate state criminal justice practices...” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1388](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))
  
* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1388&annotation=QGNXNT29) “... state-specific political history and political institutions influence the actions of players in state-specific penal and political fields.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1388](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P)) State level variation moderated the broader, national-level trends.
  
* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1388&annotation=8U7NUQPF) “... we find that developments at the state level in each period had significant feedback effects... ” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1388](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P)) National candidates drew on *successful* state experiments to bolster their own political fortunes.
  
* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1389&annotation=9SMBK6XP) “... reconfigured the penal and political fields over time.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1389](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P)) Over time this reconfigured the penal order. This creates a whole industry, as it were, where people labor, think, and devise up solutions to the problems of the new order.

![[campbellTransformationAmericaPenal2013_fig1.png]]

### Destabilization

#### Presidential politics

* At the macro-level during this time period, change created opportunities for political actors who saw crime as a winning political issue.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1390&annotation=IG3G97AY) “At the macrolevel, social and political events, such as such civil rights and antiwar protests, advances for African-Americans, and increases in reported crime, began to reconfigure and create new opportunities in the penal and political fields.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1390](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))
	  
* Republicans found a successful splinter issue.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1390&annotation=MZ9LTR45) “... prompted many working-class white voters to leave the Democratic Party, cementing the end of the New Deal coalition... ” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1390](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))
	  
* Make it about race while making it seem, on its face, racially neutral.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1391&annotation=EXLQF2UN)“... 'emphasized that you have to face the fact that the whole problem is really the blacks. The key is to devise a system that recognizes this while not appearing to.'” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1391](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))

#### Federal Crime Policy

* Democrats and Johnson respond based on this perceived political weakness.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1391&annotation=YM8DHWTU) “Johnson’s administration responded by proposing to expand the federal government’s role in crime control.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1391](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))
	  
* Accelerates under Nixon.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1391&annotation=6T5PHNZR) “... President Nixon expanded federal funding for state crime control grants sevenfold, facilitating the professionalization and centralization of criminal justice systems across the United States and drastically increasing law enforcement capacity.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1391](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))

#### Federal Courts

* You would have thought this would have held back the tides of mass incarceration. Civil rights lawyers and judges greatly expanded the rights of criminal defendants during this time period.\
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1392&annotation=IL2F7PRH) “Ultimately, by extending federal protection of civil rights behind bars, federal courts and civil rights lawyers became powerful new players in state penal fields, helping to destabilize the old penal order and changing the terms under which it could be reconstructed.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1392](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P)) 

#### State Developments

* Police officers are the only people holding back the jungle from taking over. California's populist ballot initiative process allowed for the new penal order to emerge sooner vs. New York which is more centralized and elite-governed (although the Rockefeller example doesn't exactly convince me this stopped the new penal order from taking over sooner).
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1392&annotation=QL44QR8L) “... Ronald Reagan reiterated the link between social protest and crime... ” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1392](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))
	  
* Leads to formation of new interest groups and professional societies who can lobby for their interests.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1393&annotation=3HNDUUQH) “... hiring and training police, building riot squads, and collecting crime and criminal justice statistics. Of critical importance, LEAA funding helped create and organize victims’ rights groups... ” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1393](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))
	  
* People argue from the Left and the Right, we see an emerging critique of the criminal justice system and the status quo as untenable.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1393&annotation=YHL5Q6KK) 
	* I never understood why people on the left would be on board, though, with such a huge expansion in the criminal justice system. Did they just go along? Thought it would be fair? Politically easy?
	  
* So early on, we do see positive outcomes result from the destabilization of the existing order. Did liberal/left people lose faith in the rehabilitative ideal? Too paternalistic? Not the place of the criminal justice system? Going back to Juvenile Justice, maybe they thought these were band-aid reforms which impeded more structural and fundamental changes from happening which would ultimately solve the problems.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1394&annotation=2NGNAKEW) “Thus in Washington, at least, the outcome of destabilization was rhetoric and policies specifically focused on decarceration. And in Oregon, a state with fewer serious crime problems, less political contestation, and no official challenges to the prison system, destabilization did not occur until 'law and order' once again appeared on the national scene with the election of Ronald Reagan.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1394](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))

#### State Feedback Effects

* As mentioned earlier, there were these state feedback effects which accelerated the whole process. These little incubators in each state provided the national government with more ideas and solutions to the crime problem which reinforced the new penal order.
  
* And then the only solution would be more prisons I suppose.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1394&annotation=TX96PFRT) “... guaranteed that offenders would continue to be sent to already overcrowded correctional agencies—prompting new problems for state officials and further response by the federal courts.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1394](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))
	  
* Perversion of victim's rights.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1394&annotation=BBR5PMPL) “... victims’ rights organizations through prosecutors’ offices created 'a very particular kind of victim’s movement... that viewed the rights of victims as a zero-sum game predicated on tougher penalties for offenders.'” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1394](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))

### Contestation

* The rehabilitative model had collapsed but incapacitation had yet to emerge as the replacement solution. It seems possible decarceration was just as viable a policy solution at this time.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1395&annotation=CBCBDFE8) “In the official parlance 'rehabilitation didn’t work,' but 'incapacitation' had yet to emerge as a dominant framework for policy or practice.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1395](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))
	  
* President Reagan -> crime control had political power -> state Republicans (and some Democrats) latched onto his coattails -> Recreating the dynamics mentioned above.
* War on drugs -> Kept forcing the issue of prison capacity problems -> we need more prisons.
* Increased federal court monitoring (and all the additional other factors) of prison conditions led states to commit more resources to contain criminal offenders in prisons.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1395&annotation=4LKRDZKL) “Thus, mass incarceration was not a historical inevitability in 1980... ” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1395](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))

#### Presidential Politics

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1396&annotation=GJUEV7HZ) “Reagan reemphasized crime, propelling it to the forefront of Americans’ concerns, even as rates of serious offending were stable or declining.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1396](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))

#### Federal Crime Policy

* No decarceration and no funding for social support services outside of the criminal justice system. War on drugs! Supercharges everything. Incentivize state and local officials.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1396&annotation=GZBUV9FN) “... this framing precluded solutions anchored outside of the criminal justice system.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1396](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P)) 

#### State Developments

* Reagan provided a model for state-level Republicans to win.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1397&annotation=K4WVE9BA) “President Reagan’s victory and his administration’s law enforcement initiatives signaled a new political pathway for insurgent state Republicans.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1397](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))
	  
* Created legislative gridlock where *sometimes* expansion of the criminal justice system was the only way out. Other times it just caused plain old gridlock. And in other places, it took more time for this new penal order to gain efficacy because of state politics, the political order, demographics, history, etc. Over time, the strength of these forces eventually reached everywhere though.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1398&annotation=ISJB6I5H) “In all of these states, the changes to the political field created legislative gridlock mainly with Republican governors and Democratic legislatures, increasing the value of tough-on-crime initiatives as a sign of government effectiveness and as one of the few avenues for political compromise.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1398](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))

* Expansion of interest groups and professionalization of these groups. Were able to tap more and more federal funding streams. [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1398&annotation=XV37JY2M)
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1399&annotation=TW5AG9TB) “Together, law enforcement and victims’ interest groups played a key role in shaping public perceptions of the crime problem by framing the problem in the media. In particular, they argued that the only way to keep violent criminals off the streets was to build more prisons, that it was less expensive to house prisoners than let them roam the streets, and that the system protected criminals’ rights at the expense of victims.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1399](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))
	  
* The only solution was more prisons. Interesting effect of courts constantly holding states responsible for poor prison conditions -> instead of decreasing the population, they just built more capacity.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1399&annotation=9MV6MXYP)“This framing, along with increased admissions to prison because of the war on drugs and heightened court monitoring of overcrowded conditions in state prisons, created a sense of crisis in state criminal justice systems.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1399](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))
	  
* State-level factors all played a role in when mass incarceration happened in their state. However, national-level trends proved to be too powerful for any state to resist.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1400&annotation=WS5Y3WKN) “However, changes were not uniform across the states we examined. Several state-specific factors affected the timing and degree of the punitive shift in policy, including a state’s willingness (California and Arizona) or reluctance (Texas and Florida) to abandon fiscal conservatism, the intensity of partisan competition for control of the legislature (Texas) or lack thereof (New York, Minnesota), the continued willingness to embrace alternatives to incarceration and invest in crime prevention efforts (New York, Minnesota, Washington), and the creation of state agencies that insulated sentencing policy from crime politics (Washington and Minnesota).” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1400](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))

#### State Feedback Effects

* Democrats have to play the game as well.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1400&annotation=LT7P22GQ) “Democrats at the state level increasingly found themselves unable to effectively counter crime politics. Consequently, many decided they could not cede 'crime' to the Republicans and during the reconstruction period they proactively worked to fortify their tough-on-crime credentials.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1400](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1400&annotation=BMIB6H4U) “... increased the size and clout of corrections officers’ unions and of the local communities where prisons were built, who then advocated for job security and job creation.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1400](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))

### Reconstruction

The state-level processes initiated earlier on now accelerate the issues we're seeing at the national level, Democrats get on board
* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1401&annotation=PBRMNNWS) “Unlike the contested period where presidential politics and federal crime control programs steered state-level policy responses, during the reconstruction period national-level politics and policy drew upon and ultimately reinforced increasingly radical state-level policies. As Democrats sought to bolster their tough-on-crime image, newly elected president Bill Clinton drew from state initiatives such as 'three-strikes and you’re out' and 'truth-in-sentencing,' and Congress used federal crime control policy to subsidize and encourage the diffusion of similar measures across the states.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1401](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P)) .

#### Federal Crime Policy

* Even among Democrats, we see how the state-level changes initiated by earlier national changes supercharged the new penal order.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1403&annotation=A5RPFNTG) “Once in office, Clinton worked to follow through on one of his key campaign promises—to put '100,000 more police officers on the streets.'” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1403](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P)) 

#### Federal Courts

* This development was guided by the increasingly Conservative Supreme Court. [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1403&annotation=25A7SI8J) “During the reconstruction period federal courts largely exited the penal policy stage in regulating conditions of confinement and sentencing, giving state legislatures a free hand in reconstructing new penal regimes.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1403](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))

#### State Developments

* We still see some moderating effects from state-level variables.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1405&annotation=RSDQHXWC) “However, in states with less partisan competition for legislative control, such as Minnesota and New York, Democratic legislators continued to modify and moderate hastily proposed crime bills that would drain state resources.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1405](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))
	  
* State-level incarceration trends likely reflect real and important differences concerning the political makeup of these states even as they all succumbed to the broader new penal order. [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1407&annotation=2DSN6EZP)

#### State Feedback Effects

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1408&annotation=7HL9PT7W) “... captured crime politics feeds back into a wide variety of policy arenas. Examples abound demonstrating that making something 'a crime' has become the appropriate cultural and political response to public problems and moral panics.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1408](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))

### Conclusion

* In an ever-escalating series of back and forth responses, the criminal justice system became more and more punitive.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1409&annotation=L9FNEUJX) “For Weber, 'the sources of patterned action, the appropriate focus of sociological inquiry, are extremely pluralistic... All attempts to locate a ‘resting point’—a single causal force—must be seen as a futile endeavor'. Similarly, we argue that the nature of the transformation of the penal order in the United States over the second half of the 20th century is best explained by the successive policy outcomes of back-and-forth interaction between state and national-level political and penal processes.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1409](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))
	  
* Mass incarceration wasn't inevitable.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1410&annotation=X4BIRLFU) “However, we found little to suggest that some inherent aspect of the social and economic arrangements of late-modern society necessarily equated to stricter forms of state-sanctioned social control.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1410](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))
	  
* Racism produced the unique system of mass incarceration in which we find ourselves.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JIVV4KAL?page=1411&annotation=ERPYYCXK) “... unique system of racial exclusion, discrimination, and stratification in the United States created the context in which crime politics could flourish.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1411](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))
	  
* It was not a grand design or master plan or unified ideology. Guided by short-term thinking, strategies for elections.

In the states we examined, punitive policies did not necessarily go hand in hand with free market policies or policies that undermined the welfare state even if this was an eventual effect of mass incarceration.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1411](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))

* Even as we saw mass incarceration increase dramatically across the country, there is still across state variation which can be traced back to the state's early policy decisions before the new penal order emerged.

Legislators in Washington and Minnesota, for example, created Sentencing Guidelines Commissions that eventually acted as important institutional barriers to continuous increases in sentence lengths” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1413](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))
	  
* The states which had moderate approaches weren't important politically at the national level.

We argue, therefore, that the study of crime politics in populous swing states, such as Ohio, Pennsylvania, or Nevada may be worthy of additional scholarly attention.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1414](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))
	  
* We need to examine these edge cases more.

Ultimately, a proactive judiciary worked with nonprofits, local communities, and treatment providers to help initiate a striking reversal of the state’s incarceration rates.” ([Campbell and Schoenfeld, 2013, p. 1414](zotero://select/library/items/E2F4D83P))

* Things can take on a life of their own. Variables which were once important cease to become important. Weber is correct to point out how multiple factors can combine to produce outcomes of interest. Static analyses miss this.
