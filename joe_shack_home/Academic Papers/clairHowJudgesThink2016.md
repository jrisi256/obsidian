## Abstract

Researchers have theorized how judges’ decision-making may result in the disproportionate presence of Blacks and Latinos in the criminal justice system. Yet, we have little evidence about how judges make sense of these disparities and what, if anything, they do to address them. By drawing on 59 interviews with state judges in a Northeastern state, we describe, and trace the implications of, judges’ understandings of racial disparities at arraignment, plea hearings, jury selection, and sentencing. Most judges in our sample attribute disparities, in part, to differential treatment by themselves and/or other criminal justice officials, whereas some judges attribute disparities only to the disparate impact of poverty and differences in offending rates. To address disparities, judges report employing two categories of strategies: noninterventionist and interventionist. Noninterventionist strategies concern only a judge's own differential treatment, whereas interventionist strategies concern other actors’ possible differential treatment, as well as the disparate impact of poverty and facially neutral laws. We reveal how the use of noninterventionist strategies by most judges unintentionally reproduces disparities. Through our examination of judges’ understandings of racial disparities throughout the court process, we enhance understandings of American racial inequality and theorize a situational approach to decision-making in organizational contexts.

## My notes

**Main Research Question**: What do judges themselves think about racial disparities? What do they do, if anything, about these disparities to try and limit them?

**Methods**: Interviewed 59 judges in a Northeastern state and conducted observational studies.

**Introduction & Theory**

- Why is there an overrepresentation of minorities in the criminal justice system?
  
	- **Disparate Impact**:
		- They offend at higher rates and/or they’re disproportionately susceptible to the sanctions of facially neutral laws.
	- **Differential Treatment**:
		- Racial disparities arise from overt or implicit discriminatory treatment by the law.
		
	- The two are intertwined but most research has found support for the latter. Minorities are treated more punitively net of differences in criminal offending or policies which disproportionately impact minorities.

- Situational Context

	- Strategies to reduce disparity depend on the situational context of each stage in the system and may not address the underlying factors causing disparity in the system.    
	- Interventionist vs. Non-Interventionist Strategies (not judges).

**Approach**: Consider judicial decision making at: 1) arraignment, 2) plea hearings, 3) jury selection, and 4) sentencing.

**Findings**:

- Nearly all judges acknowledged and expressed concern over racial disparities. Some judges noted its systemic and institutional. Most were open about admitting their own biases.
    
- Judges noted how other actors take discretion away from judges to address disparities.
    
- Most judges acknowledged both disparate impact and differential treatment as contributing factors to disparity. Some only acknowledged disparate impact believing judges to be fair.
    
- **Arraignment**

	- NI: Believe lawyers have more information than they do and defer to them.
	- I: Some judges will explicitly call out prosecutors if they think the decision is biased.
    
- **Pleas**
    
	- NI: Most judges accept a deal struck between the defense and prosecution.
	- I: Some judges still will play a more active role to level the playing field as they see it.
    
- **Jury Selection**
    
	- NI: Judges want to make themselves seem fair, neutral, and impartial. They worry about playing too much of an active role.
	  
	- I: Other judges will take an active role in ensuring the jury is as diverse as possible.

- **Sentencing**
    
	- NI: Most judges don’t account for racial disparities in their sentencing and feel like they cannot. Each sentence has to be individually tailored in a trial. They feel as if racial disparities from previous stages are already locked in. “I’m not meant to equalize it.” Most say the best they can do is to be internally consistent and have themselves be fair.
	  
	- I: They will strive for external consistency across the full criminal justice system. They’ll consider minority or low-income status as a mitigating factor.

### Discussion Questions

1. Do we think proponents of sentencing guidelines would argue this is evidence of why we need more policies like the guidelines to promote uniformity and consistency? Or do we think even proponents of sentencing guidelines would believe this is evidence as to how uniformity in one stage or even multiple stages of the criminal sentence perpetuates disparity? What do you think?
    
2. Did any of the non-interventionist or interventionist arguments strike you as being reasonable or unreasonable? Do you think this paper provides an argument for creating a more activist role for the judiciary?
    
3. How should calls for systemic reform and radically remaking the criminal justice system be balanced with more gradual calls for reforms like diversifying the makeup of the judiciary? Note that minority judges were more likely to employ interventionist strategies with respect to at least one of the stages.
