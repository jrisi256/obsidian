## Abstract

Meta-analytic techniques were used to determine which predictor domains and actuarial assessment instruments were the best predictors of adult offender recidivism. One hundred and thirty-one studies produced 1,141 correlations with recidivism. The strongest predictor domains were criminogenic needs, criminal history/history of antisocial behavior, social achievement, age/gender/race, and family factors. Less robust predictors included intellectual functioning, personal distress factors, and socioeconomic status in the family of origin. Dynamic predictor domains performed at least as well as the static domains. The LSI-R was identified as the most useful actuarial measure. Recommendations for developing sound assessment practices in corrections are provided.

## My notes

### Research Question

We need to verify the risk factors most predictive of adult offender recidivism.

1. Which predictor domains predict recidivism the best?
2. Are dynamic predictors inferior to static predictors?
3. How do third-generation instruments fare when compared against one another (criminogenic need vs. personality-based tests)?
4. Are the strongest predictors of recidivism related to any particular criminological theories?

### Background

* [[Static risk factors]] -> Aspects of an offender's past which cannot be changed but are predictive of future recidivism (e.g., previous convictions).
  
* [[Dynamic risk factors]] -> These are aspects of an offender's life that are mutable and usually suggested as appropriate avenues of treatment.

* Debate in the criminological field as to what the best predictors are -> for scientific and perhaps ideological reasons, less emphasis has been placed on individual factors and dispositions (the more dynamic factors).
  
### History of risk assessment

1. First-generation techniques were based on clinical intuition and professional judgment. This approach is not considered reputable anymore.
   
2. Second-generation techniques began to become more actuarial. They are based almost entirely on static criminal history items and provided little direction for treatment decisions because the variables were static.
   
3. Third-generation techniques -> **1)** One type of instrument assesses *criminogenic need*. **2)** The second type assesses personality.

Previous reviews of risk assessments have been largely narrative.

### Results

* 18 predictive variables collapsed into 8 domains:
	* Age/gender/race.
	* Criminal history.
	* Criminogenic needs.
	* Family factors.
	* Intellectual functioning.
	* Personal distress.
	* SES status.
	* Social achievement.

#### Question 1

All predictor domains were significant predictors of recidivism. Most predictive domains were:

1. Adult criminal history.
2. Antisocial personality.
3. Companions.
4. Criminogenic needs.

It should be noted, though, that even the most predictive factors (composite scales) only achieved a [[correlation coefficient]] value of 0.3.

#### Question 2

Dynamic risk factors, as a whole, did perform worse than static risk factors.

#### Question 3

Criminogenic need instruments which produce risk scales performed better than antisocial personality scales and instruments.

### Conclusions

* Early family factors and pre-adult antisocial behavior are rarely included in risk prediction instruments, but they were found to have moderate correlations with adult recidivism.
  
* Personal distress and IQ were not particularly correlated with adult recidivism.
  
* Hard to speak about if these results would generalize across offense categories -> some limited evidence to suggest different offense categories would have different risk factors.
  
* Theoretically, [[differential association]] came out the best as criminogenic needs and antisocial associates were the biggest correlates of recidivism. Personal distress, intellect, and SES were the least predictive of adult recidivism.
