## Abstract

The unprecedented growth of the penal system in the United States has motivated an expansive volume of research on the collateral consequences of punishment. In this review, we take stock of what is known about these collateral consequences, particularly in the domains of health, employment, housing, debt, civic involvement, families, and communities. Yet the full reckoning of the formal and informal consequences of mass incarceration and the tough-on-crime era is hindered by a set of thorny challenges that are both methodological and theoretical in nature. We examine these enduring challenges, which include (a) the importance of minimizing selection bias, (b) consideration of treatment heterogeneity, and (c) identification of causal mechanisms underlying collateral consequences. We conclude the review with a focused discussion on promising directions for future research, including insights into data infrastructure, opportunities for policy tests, and suggestions for expanding the field of inquiry.

## My notes

#paper_idea -> This paper will be very useful for identifying the gaps in the literature.

### Scope of the criminal justice system in the USA

* Incredible amount of variability across states both in terms of practices and the number of people per capita incarcerated.
  
* Mass incarceration cannot end by focusing only on the release of nonviolent drug offenders. Focusing on such a population also ignores how little crime-type specialization occurs among the criminally involved.
  
* The federal system is tiny compared to the state system. However, the federal criminal justice is heavily involved in criminal immigrant deportations which ramped up greatly during the Obama presidency.

### Average effects of criminal justice involvement

* Incarceration is associated with: 
	* Poor physical and mental health outcomes for individuals and families.
	* Declining employment prospects and future earnings.
	* Breakup of fragile families.
	* Reductions in civic and institutional engagement.
	* Increases in material insecurity and reliance on public assistance.
	* Rising legal debt.
	* Housing and residential instability.
	* Poor educational and health outcomes for children.
	* Declining levels of neighborhood informal social control and collective efficacy.
	* Increasing [[Legal cynicism]].
	* Elevated rates of crime and recidivism.
	* Concentrated among poor men and racial/ethnic minorities men.
### Challenges for Future Research

* Minimize [[selection bias]] in studies of the effects of conviction and incarceration.
  
	* Every study must account for the larger differences between the people selected into incarceration and the people not selected into incarceration. See [[gottfredsonGeneralTheoryCrime1990]] and [[Social control theory|social control]] specifically [[self-control]]. The effects of incarceration are likely to be, at least, a little spurious (the effects post-incarceration as well as the incarceration status itself are the effect of some [[confounders]]).

	* Counterfactuals are likely inadequate. E.g., comparing the incarcerated to those who receive probation. The ubiquity of pretrial detention means those who receive probation still likely served some time in jail/prison. This muddies the comparison when trying to estimate the causal effect of incarceration.
	  
		* Neighborhood studies are also plagued by this problem. The ideal counterfactual neighborhood is one which is similar on levels of disadvantage but has a low incarceration rate.
		
* **Solutions**:
	* Use jail as the treatment status (those jailed vs. those never jailed).
	* Compare those incarcerated to those who will later be incarcerated.
	* Compare recent vs. multiple incarcerations.
	* [[Placebo regressions]].
	* Compare to people who have been separated from their community for other reasons (e.g., the military).
	* Compare the effect of incarceration at one prison vs. another.
	* Look to #random_judges . We could also look to the random assignment of probation and parole officers.
	* Look to policy shocks (big example is the [[California Public Safety Realignment Act]]).
	  
* Consider [[treatment heterogeneity]] in the collateral consequences of incarceration.
	* Heterogeneity based on individual characteristics, based on type of criminal justice contact, base on type of facility, duration of incarceration, availability of rehabilitation programs and the quality/safety of the prison.
	  
* Work needs to be done to identify the causal mechanisms in play.
