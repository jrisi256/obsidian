## Abstract

Any thorough understanding of the modern epidemics of AIDS and tuberculosis in Haiti or elsewhere in the postcolonial world requires a thorough knowledge of history and political economy. This essay, based on over a decade of research in rural Haiti, draws on the work of Sidney Mintz and others who have linked the interpretive project of modern anthropology to a historical understanding of the large-scale social and economic structures in which affliction is embedded. The emergence and persistence of these epidemics in Haiti, where they are the leading causes of young adult death, is rooted in the enduring effects of European expansion in the New World and in the slavery and racism with which it was associated. A syncretic and properly biosocial anthropology of these and other plagues moves us beyond noting, for example, their strong association with poverty and social inequalities to an understanding of how such inequalities are embodied as differential risk for infection and, among those already infected, for adverse outcomes including death. Since these two diseases have different modes of transmission, different pathophysiologies, and different treatments, part of the interpretive task is to link such an anthropology to epidemiology and to an understanding of differential access to new diagnostic and therapeutic tools now available to the fortunate few.

## My notes

### Class discussion

- Critiques of [[structural violence]] and structural vulnerability.

	- Not enough nuance in this model. Certainly poverty plays a role in drug addiction and making it more likely. However, most people in poverty are not addicted to drugs.
    
	- In pushing back against individualized models of drug usage, the pendulum swings too far and disregards individual agency. Does this not do damage to the individuals involved?
    
	- So what? What are the policy implications of this? How do we fix these problems? Is throwing money at the problem the solution? What specifically would need to happen to fix the problems?
    
- Sampling issues → chronically homeless and people in deep poverty are very easy to access and talk to and survey. This overly informs our opinions and beliefs on drug overdoses?
    
- Overdose rate difference between USA and Western Europe → healthcare? Chronic pain (stress, diet, unsafe working conditions, lack of exercise)?
    
### Introduction

- Structural Violence → Liberation theologists described it as sinful social structures which enable poverty, racism, and inequality.
    
- Distant (we observe it all the time in places separate from us), invisible (in the sense it is hard to recognize as something not natural), massive → normalization of unequal power relations (e.g., intimate partner violence). Adaptations to everyday violence.
    
- It is exerted systematically by everyone involved, indirectly.
    
- It resists the placing of responsibility on individual actors.
    
- It constricts the agency of the actors involved → socialization for scarcity. “Hunger is misery but a full belly means trouble.”

### Examples
    

- Erasing history, subtly and gradually. “No one becomes responsible for the present.”
    
- Anthropology derives its power from its ability to regenerate lost contexts and revive the history that the powerful would otherwise want forgotten.
    
#### History of Haiti
    
- After it gained its independence in a destructive war, they had to pay reparations to France and agree to exploitative trade deals to export their products.
    
- The USA continues to freeze funds and aid sent to Haiti to enforce its political will and extract favorable economic conditions.
    
- All of this is connected to the direct day-to-day living of the Haitian people as well as their health. We cannot understand biology without understanding history.
    
- HIV in Haiti is determined through its proximity (not distance) to the USA → HIV in Haiti did not come from Africa. To understand biology, we need to understand history → sexual tourism.
    
- The health of those elites who live in more unequal societies is worse than the elite who live in more equal societies. We may need to appeal to their own self-interest to improve things.
    
- The job of the anthropologist is to zoom out from the micro conditions being observed to better understand the machinery which produced such conditions. How can the AIDS crisis in modern day Haiti be linked to its legacy as a slave colony two hundred years ago?
    
- Complicating point → How do we deal with and study social structures we find terrible? E.g., female circumcision in Sudan. Farmer criticizes those who confuse structural violence with cultural difference → this comes from the fact anthropologists are often *looking down* upon those with less power than them, this group of people is alien to me, they’re somehow fundamentally different.
    
	- “Oh, it’s part of their culture.”
    
- “... more fine-grained and systemic analyses of power and privilege in discussions of who is likely to suffer and in what ways.” → primacy of class (compares Black taxi driver to Black football player).
    
- “The capacity to suffer is clearly… human. But not all suffering is equal, in spite of pernicious and often self-serving identity politics…”
    
- His claim is that the poor are the ones suffering the most, and they are the ones most being silenced.
    
### Critiques
    
- Structural violence is still too poorly defined. It is too linear and deterministic.
    
- Problems with structural violence as a concept:
    
	- Sometimes it is quite visible and its perpetrators are quite obvious.
    
	- Conflates full-fledged domination with social disparity and then collapses forms of violence which need to be differentiated (physical, economic, symbolic).
    
	- It is saturated with moral judgment and is tainted by a *present bias*. Slavery is widely condemned today. However, that is a very recent development in human history. Its history did need to be erased (and has not been erased) because they did not think it sinful enough to have its history erased.
    
	- It is a rhetorically useful tool but not useful as a scientific one.
