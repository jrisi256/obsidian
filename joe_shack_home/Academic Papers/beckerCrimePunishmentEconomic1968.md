## My notes

### Introduction

* How many resources and how much punishment should be used to enforce different types of legislation?
* The inverse of the above question: How many offenses should be permitted and how many offenders should go unpunished?
* Optimal amount of enforcement is based on -> **1)** cost of catching and convicting offenders, **2)** nature of the punishment (fines vs. prison terms) and associated costs and benefits, and **3)** responses of offenders to change in enforcement.
* Second aim -> A useful theory of criminal behavior formed from this economic approach can dispense with most sociological and biological theories and simply extend the economist's view concerning rational decision makers.

### The model

How can we prevent crime in an optimal fashion? We must develop a model to incorporate the behavioral relations behind the currently estimated costs of crime.

1. The relationship between the number of crimes and the costs of those crimes.
2. The number of crimes committed and the number of punishments meted out.
3. The number crimes and punishments meted out and public expenditures spent on the institutions designed to punish.
4. The number of punishments and the costs of punishment.
5. The number of crimes and the amount spent privately on protection.

### Fines

* Becker is a strong proponent of fines... assuming they actually go to the victim so it would be more accurate to state he is a fan of restitution. He argues that fines are the most direct way to remedy the situation and return the system to its economic equilibrium before the crime was committed. It ensures that less costly and less effective options (e.g., rehabilitation, imprisonment) are not pursued because the victim feels like justice has not been served.
  
* Are fines just creating a price for committing a certain crime? Much like prices are set for buying goods and services? Becker argues crimes already have prices but just in different units (i.e., prison and jail time or probation). The units are fungible (money units vs. time imprisoned units) and thus people should not be got hung up on the unit.
  
* Optimal fines depend only the marginal harm and costs and not at all on the economic position of the offender. Is this unfair? Well if the goal is to minimize social loss and to not take vengeance or inflict harm on offenders, then fines need to depend on total harm done.
  
* Certain crimes are so heinous that no amount of money could be used to compensate for them. Becker accepts this criticism and folds it into the discussion of what to do when the fine exceeds the monetary resources of the offender. Becker simply states we need a more flexible fine system as well as a more flexible way of equitably combining fines with other forms of punishment.
  
* Would this not become a tool of recreating debtors prison? Those who can pay are allowed to skip incarceration. Becker argues that the unfairness lies in the length of the prison term compared to the fine. E.g., a prison term of one week compared to $10,000 would be *unfair* to a wealthy person (in the sense that the harm they caused is not equivalent to the amount of money they lose while incarcerated vs. the $10,000 they should have been able to pay + the cost the society to create the incarceration facilities).
	* Thus, optimal prison terms for those who cannot pay monetary fines is not unfair because the monetary equivalent of the prison term is less the monetary value of the optimal fine (which all equal the harm caused).
	* Becker argues this argument arises from the fact the we place a low monetary value on time in prison. E.g., in NY state, a class A misdemeanor can be punished by a prison term as long as one year or a fine of $1,000. These statutes permit excessive sentences relative to fines which explains why imprisonment is considered so unfair because poor defendants often have to choose the prison term.
	  
* Brief discussion on how we should have some sort of fine system but for rewarding people (e.g., inventors). 

### Philosophical approach

* The justice system in the USA pursues a combination of deterrence, compensation, and vengeance. These goals are somewhat contradictory and cannot all be satisfied. E.g., if the goal is full compensation, then courts become damage assessors and deterrence and vengeance or only partially pursued.
* I think Becker is arguing for this approach -> social tort law. The public is suing for public harm.
	* See white-collar crime. If compensation was stressed, the main purpose of legal proceedings would be to assess what the fines should be so as to be equivalent to the harms inflicted by the criminals. There would be no point in cease and desist letters, imprisonment, ridicule, or dissolution of companies. Firms would automatically cease any criminal activity because the gains are no longer more than the harm inflicted.
		* Or companies would pay the fines and continue the action with the acknowledgment that they're actions are net beneficial for society (?) and society is simply being compensated for the harm done while the benefits are allowed to persist.
	* If they could not pay the full fines, this is where alternative punishments would come into play.

### Summary

* Decision points:
  
	* Expenditures on the police and courts determine the probability (p) that an offense is discovered, the offender apprehended, and then convicted, the size and form (f) of the punishment.
	  
	* Optimal values can be chosen subject to **1)** *O*, the amount of damages caused by the crime, **2)** the cost of achieving a certain (p), and **3)** the effect of changes in (p) and (f) on O.
	  
	* Optimal decisions minimize social loss from offenses. This loss i the sum of damages, the costs of apprehension and conviction, and the costs of carrying out the punishment. The function can be minimized with respect to (p) and (f).
	  
* **Implications of optimization**
	* If carrying out the punishment is costly (as is the case with imprisonment and community supervision), then crime would not pay (so long as optimal values of (p) and (f) are chosen).
	* Optimal values of (p) and (f) would be greater, the greater the damaged caused by an offense.
	* Fines would be the preferred way of doling out punishment. They conserve resources, compensate society, punish offenders, and simplify the determination of optimal (p) and (f).
