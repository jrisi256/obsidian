## Abstract

Analyzing the natural histories of two samples of boys that differ dramatically in childhood delinquency, we test a model of crime and deviance over the life course. The first hypothesis is that childhood antisocial behavior predicts problems in adult development across a wide variety of dimensions. Second, we argue that social bonds in adulthood--to work and family--explain changes in crime and deviance over the life span. The longitudinal data were reconstructed from the Gluecks' classic study of delinquent and non-delinquent males from childhood to age 32. Childhood delinquency is linked to adult crime, alcohol abuse, general deviance, economic dependency, educational failure, unemployment, divorce, and even charges in the military. Despite this continuity, job stability and strong marital attachment in adulthood inhibit adult criminal and deviant behavior. The results support a model of informal social control that recognizes both stability and change in antisocial behavior over the life course.

## My notes

### Paper overview

1. Childhood antisocial behavior predicts problems in adult development across a wide variety of dimensions.
2. Argues social bonds in adulthood explain changes in crime and deviance over the lifespan.
3. Despite the continuity between adolescence and adulthood,  job stability and strong marital attachment in adulthood inhibit adult criminal and deviant behavior.
    
### Introduction

The basic thesis is that while continuity in deviant behavior exists, social ties in adulthood (work, family, community) explain changes in criminality over the lifespan. Model acknowledges the importance of early childhood behaviors while rejecting the implication that later adult factors have little relevance.

“... social interaction with adult institutions of informal social control has important effects on crime and deviance.” #quote 

Debate over how stable aggression and deviant tendencies actually are and how much they persist from childhood into adulthood. How much can things change over time?

### Hypotheses

1. Childhood antisocial behavior is linked to a wide variety of adult antisocial behaviors regardless of social class and race.

2. Social bonds to adult institutions of informal social control (e.g. family, education, neighborhood, work) influence criminal behavior over the life course despite an individual’s delinquent and antisocial background. Organizing principle is [[Social control theory|social control]]. Changes which strengthen social bonds to society in adulthood will lead to less crime/deviance.

3. It isn’t marriage or employment per se which increases social bonds. It is the quality and strength of those bonds. So having a strong attachment to one’s spouse, close emotional ties, job stability, job commitment, and ties to work.

4. It is the social investment or social capital in the relationship which dictates the salience of informal social control at the individual level.

### Measures

* Delinquency (Dependent Variable) ->
	1. Official delinquency status as designated by the design of the study.
	2. Composite scale of self, parent, and teacher reports of delinquency.
	3. Temper tantrums -> Have no idea how this is being measured.

* Adult Social Bonds (Independent Variables)
	1. Job Stability (employment status, stability of most recent employment, work habits)
	2. Job Commitment (What were your aspirations related to work?)
	3. Attachment to spouse
    
### Results

**Table 1** -> Pretty remarkable how the cross-tabs are all consistently in the direction you’d expect (delinquents have worse outcomes in almost every case).

**Table 2** -> Shows however you slice the data into delinquent and non-delinquent groups, the non-delinquent group has lower rates overall of future antisocial behavior. In the delinquent group, though, those with strong social bonds have much lower rates (even in some cases better outcomes than those non-delinquent juveniles with weak social bonding).

Furthermore, these social bond effects occur in both delinquent and non-delinquent samples which would seemingly address any selection effects. Thought-provoking point. Address this point.

### Further results

“A major question may be raised concerning these results. Do individual differences in crime within the delinquent and control confound the results?” Perhaps individuals are self-selecting themselves into more/less stable relationships with work and spouses. #quote

In any case, they find job stability and marital attachment are statistically significant and tend to have large coefficients even when controlling for past delinquent behavior. Job commitment less so once job stability and marital attachment are taken into account. Also find it isn’t marriage itself which is significant but attachment to spouse which is key.
