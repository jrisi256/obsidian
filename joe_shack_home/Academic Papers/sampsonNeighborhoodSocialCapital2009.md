## Abstract

This article treats social capital as a multidimensional phenomenon along which neighborhoods are differentially organized. The authors assess this notion by linking two original surveys carried out in Chicago based on community residents (N = 8,782) and positional leaders (N = 2,822) representing six organizational dimensions. These data are used to examine both the dimensionality and structural predictors of neighborhood social organization. Results show that the social capital of Chicago communities encapsulates four distinct dimensions at the residential level and two at the leadership level. Moreover, dimensions of leadership-based social capital are for the most part inversely related to resident-based social capital and differentially predicted by concentrated disadvantage, residential stability, and racial/ethnic diversity. Based on multidimensional scaling and clustering of the communities, the authors derive a conceptual typology highlighted by four distinct groups—Cosmopolitan Efficacy, Urban Villages, Institutional Alienation, and Conduct Norms. The authors discuss implications and suggest new directions for exploration of community differentiation.

### Introduction and problem

* How do we define social capital? How do we measure it?
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPH4RECN?page=1579&annotation=ZTDUGN4Y) “Social capital has come to mean many things to many people, so much so that critics are increasingly asking what social capital is not. Even if we can agree on a reasonably precise definition of social capital, scholars disagree about what level of analysis the concept refers to. Is it the individual? Family? Neighborhood?” ([Sampson and Graif, 2009, p. 1579](zotero://select/library/items/2GA5BJ2W))
* Broadly speaking, this article will consider social capital to be the ways communities are differentially socially organized.
	* Ties and networks
	* Collective Efficacy (separate from the number of ties, strength of ties, what is your ability to activate those ties to achieve some common good for the community, strong ties can inhibit this)
	* Organizational involvement -> capacity of community organizations to obtain extralocal resources to help sustain the neighborhood. [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPH4RECN?page=1582&annotation=VNDKZZVW)
	* Conduct norms.

### Methodological strategy

1. What are the empirical dimensions by which neighborhoods are differentially socially organized?
2. We can use these empirical definitions to create typologies.
3. Examine structural and spatial predictors of variations in clusters and dimensions

### Modeling Strategy

1. Identify the principal dimensions of social capital and create typologies using cluster analysis.
2. Analyze patterns in the location of Chicago communities relative to each other in the multidimensional structural space.
3. How do the structural variables of disadvantage, stability, and diversity predict the components of social capital?
	1. [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPH4RECN?page=1591&annotation=WYZZF5A6) “we first identify the principal underlying dimensions that indices of social capital tend to reflect. Second, we examine how, if at all, these dimensions associate with each other via a cluster analysis. Third, we analyze patterns in the location of Chicago communities relative to each other in a multidimensional structural space based on a large initial set of social capital indices. Finally, we examine possible parallels in the ways that disadvantage, stability, and diversity predict the derived components of social capital.” ([Sampson and Graif, 2009, p. 1591](zotero://select/library/items/2GA5BJ2W))

### Clusters

* Cluster 4 -> **Institutional alienation**.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPH4RECN?page=1595&annotation=J7EX69VZ) “Although leaders are thus active in trying to secure community resources, residents and leadership nonetheless appear distant, and there is a low degree of collective efficacy organizational affiliation by residents. We therefore view these communities as institutionally alienated at the level of the collective even though leaders are, perhaps because of this, busily seeking outside aid.” ([Sampson and Graif, 2009, p. 1595](zotero://select/library/items/2GA5BJ2W))
* Cluster 2 -> **Conduct Norms** or **Immigrant Communities**. High agreement about conduct norms for youth but low to medium levels of resident-based social capital on all other dimensions. Leadership contacts also score low to medium. They have, on average, medium scores for poverty, disadvantage, and residential stability. High scores on language diversity and immigrant diversity.

* Cluster 3 -> **Cosmopolitan Efficacy**. Demonstrates how community efficacy can be achieved absent an abundance of strong ties.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPH4RECN?page=1596&annotation=UAFSXTGM) “Communities included in what might be considered the Cosmopolitan Efficacy Cluster (I) have on average high collective efficacy—strong shared expectations for social action—but low local networks. Organizational involvement is medium, and the positional contacts by elites, a proxy for vertical and horizontal network ties, are highest. This configuration appears to be an interesting example of how community efficacy can be achieved in the contemporary city, absent “strong ties.” What seem to matter are strong shared expectations coupled with efficient organizational and leadership contacts. Note as well that there are low levels of active involvement by elites” ([Sampson and Graif, 2009, p. 1596](zotero://select/library/items/2GA5BJ2W))
* Cluster 1 -> **Urban Village**. Leadership not as involved perhaps because they do not have to be.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPH4RECN?page=1597&annotation=XQFFDCII) “The Urban Village Cluster (III) is the social capital cluster par excellence, Robert Putnam’s ideal configuration. It includes communities with the highest levels of social capital on all dimensions...” ([Sampson and Graif, 2009, p. 1597](zotero://select/library/items/2GA5BJ2W))

### Results

* Structurally proximate neighborhoods tend to also be close geographically.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPH4RECN?page=1597&annotation=AH2JJ5HT) “reveals that the structurally proximate neighborhoods tend also to be close in geographical space or spatial proximity (see also Sampson et al., 1999).” ([Sampson and Graif, 2009, p. 1597](zotero://select/library/items/2GA5BJ2W))
* Shared expectations for social control vs. personal resources, attitudes, and behaviors influence each other somewhat, but they are independent constructs with likely independent social processes of formation and consequences.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPH4RECN?page=1600&annotation=25RKECKM) “Our analyses suggest that communities with high scores on collective efficacy have surprisingly low scores on residents’ networks in the neighborhood, conduct norms, and leadership involvement in traditional religious and school organizations—leading to what we called “cosmopolitan efficacy.”” ([Sampson and Graif, 2009, p. 1600](zotero://select/library/items/2GA5BJ2W))
* Important final point. Disadvantage, diversity, and population turnover are not associated with every aspect of social capital. For example, neighborhoods can have dense network ties and agreed upon conduct norms while still having high disadvantage. Additionally, communities can have high collective efficacy but also high population turnover.
	* Policy implication -> To the extent that an intervention targets certain dimensions of social capital, they will (or will not) be impeded by things like racial/ethnic heterogeneity, disadvantage, and high population turnover.
