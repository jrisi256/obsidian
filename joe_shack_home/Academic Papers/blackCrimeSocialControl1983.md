## Abstract

[[Social control theory|Social control]] theory predicts and explains how people define and respond to deviant behavior. One kind of social control is known as self-help: the expression of a grievance by unilateral aggression such as personal violence or property destruction. It is commonly believed that self-help was largely displaced by law in the Western world during the Middle Ages, and that it has survived primarily in the traditional--especially stateless--societies studied by anthropologists. In fact, much of the conduct classified as crime in modern societies such as the United States is similar to these traditional modes of social control and may properly be understood as self-help. Several implications follow, including the possibility of predicting and explaining a significant amount of crime with a sociological theory of self-help, itself a branch of the theory of social control.

## My notes

### Introduction

* One kind of social control is self-help: expression of grievance by aggression through personal violence or property destruction. Self-help was displaced by law in the Western world during the Middle Ages. Survived in stateless, traditional societies. Much crime in modern societies is similar to traditional modes of social control and may properly be understood as self-help. The implication being a significant amount of crime can be explained and predicted with a theory of self-help, a branch of social control.

### Self-help in traditional societies

* Much crime is moralistic and involves pursuit of justice, a mode of conflict management.
* Violence against a person or property, in traditional societies, tends to be an expression of a grievance by one person or group against another. Rather than being outlawed, it’s used as a form of social control. Important to note, this isn’t representative of all traditional society or even of those traditional societies where such practices are common.

### Modern self-help

* Thus homicide, rape, property damage (crimes in today’s society) are responses to crime in traditional societies.
  
* However, in modern society, these responses are also because the perpetrator viewed them as a necessary response to an act they viewed, themselves, as deviant. Gives an example in Houston in 1969, 50% of homicides occurred during a quarrel and 25% were in self-defense or due to provocation. Doesn’t deny crime can be multidimensional, of course. Lots of other examples of people engaging in crime to combat that which they view as wrong.
  
* As is the problem, victims of moralistic crime may be completely unaware of why they’ve been selected for punishment.
  
* Introduce idea of “collective liability” -> all people of a social category are held accountable for the conduct of each of their fellows. Think of a police officer being targeted by someone whose friend was abused by cops. A burglar targeting rich people.

### Involving the law, state monopoly on violence

* When a moralistic crime is handled by the police and/or in court, the official definition of the event is drastically different from that of the people involved. Somebody who shoots their wife’s lover is the perpetrator and the murdered adulterer is the victim (vice versa in killer’s mind). Thus in contrast to the [[sykesTechniquesNeutralizationTheory1957]] “neutralization” argument, offenders don’t think they did anything wrong. Do what they think is right and are willing to suffer the consequences -> martyrs in a sense.
  
* Thus, the struggle between self-help and the law continues even if it’s less rancorous than it once was.
  
* To the degree people feel morally obligated to break the law, the deterrent effect of the law will be weakened although not eliminated, of course. [[Deterrence theory]] must acknowledge this.
  
* Related question is the extent to which victimization is deterred by self-help rather than, or in addition to, the law.
  
* Regardless, juries and the law tend to process self-help crimes quite leniently. See the expansion of self-defense laws (Florida -> Stand Your Ground laws). Lynchings in the USA were almost never prosecuted. Assaults between intimates are hardly charged to the fullest extent allowable.
  
* If the law has a hard time deterring self-help in the first place, this leniency surely doesn’t help things. But why does so much self-help occur in the USA?

### Return to history

* [[Hobbes]] may have overstated his theory a little bit. Nevertheless interpersonal violence does appear to be more frequent in stateless societies and subsections of society (gambling, prostitution, drug trade). African-Americans enjoy less legal protection as well. Is it a way to mobilize the law when the law might otherwise ignore you?
  
* Thus, the USA has many stateless societies where Hobbesian logic would rule.
  
* Opposite condition would be totalitarian states where interpersonal violence withers away, and the state handles any and all disputes. Citizens actively use the coercive powers of the state against one another.
  
* Important to keep in mind that law and self-help are unevenly distributed across social space and as a result this will determine the extent to which behavior is punished through the law or through self-help.
