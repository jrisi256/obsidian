## Abstract

Developments in a number of academic disciplines-the sociology of deviance, criminology, economics, psychology-suggest that it is useful to see criminal behavior not as the result of psychologically and socially determined dispositions to offend, but as the outcome of the offender's broadly rational choices and decisions. This perspective provides a basis for devising models of criminal behavior that (1) offer frameworks within which to locate existing research, (2) suggest directions for new research, (3) facilitate analysis of existing policy, and (4) help to identify potentially fruitful policy initiatives. Such models need not offer comprehensive explanations; they may be limited and incomplete, yet still be "good enough" to achieve these important policy and research purposes. To meet this criterion they need to be specific to particular forms of crime, and they need separately to describe both the processes of involvement in crime and the decisions surrounding the commission of the offense itself. Developing models that are crime specific and that take due account of rationality will also demand more knowledge about the ways in which offenders process and evaluate relevant information. Such a decision perspective appears to have most immediate payoff for crime control efforts aimed at reducing criminal opportunity.

## My notes

The goal of this research should be to guide crime control policy and to be *good enough*. It does not have to perfect or correct. It should be useful and soon as a more useful model appears, we can discard this current model.

### Section 1: The history of modern rational choice theory

[[Deterrence theory|Rational choice]] emerged from the merging of many different disciplines as people focused in on the individual cognitive thought processes of people as they decide to commit a deviant act or not.

* **Sociology**: [[beckerOutsidersStudiesSociology1963]] and [[sykesTechniquesNeutralizationTheory1957]] point to how offenders rationalize their behaviors. See their behaviors as rational responses to their situations. Points to many other studies showing how crime is learned, accepted, rationalized, and weighed in terms of costs and benefits -> even apparently impulsive or very violent acts. Claims that because sociology does not focus on policy or quantitative research methods, their conclusions and the generalizability of their findings are suspect.
  
* **Criminology**: Criminals make their decisions on where to commit crimes based on factors of the environment and hard/easy it will be to commit the crime safely -> policy studies which show that environmental design decisions which increase the risk or reduce opportunities can reduce the incidence rate of crime -> need to situation these findings within a coherent theoretical framework -> ones provided by sociology are not good enough for policy purposes.
  
* **Economics**: Crime can be understood as any other behavior. An individual make rational calculations as to what will yield them the most benefit for the least effort and least amount of tolerable risk -> Provides some hope that crime can in fact be deterred. Economists need to focus more on gathering and use individual-level empirical data on decision making from other fields to make their theories less abstract and more applied. Need to take into account factors to help explain individual variation.
  
* **Cognitive Psychology**: Turn towards behaviorism and a focus on incentives, deterrents, situational cues, and opportunities -> rational choice theories are not so radically behaviorally deterministic though -> focus on social learning and how crime is learned through imitation and reinforcement. Their data also shows how people are imperfect decision makers often making less than optimal decisions -> focus on how people make decisions in the moment and how they use past information + values + heuristic cognitive shortcuts to make decision making easier even if not optimal. -> decisions make individually vs. a group also influence one's appetite for risk. The discipline is still very young, though, and not fully developed.

### Section 2: 

Synthesize all the above findings from all the fields into one coherent theory. Their proposed schematic models are the "blueprints of a theory".

* Distinction between explaining involvement of particular individuals in crime and explaining the occurrence of criminal events. Most criminologists and sociologists have assumed that by using social and psychological variables to explain who will get involved with crime, that this is all that's needed to explain the rate of crime acts being committed. The existence of a motivated offender is only part of the equation. Also people can be involved in crime at different levels.
* Models have to be crime specific. There are important differences between types of crime: who commits them, nature of the motivations involved, and the behaviors/skills/connections required. **For policy purposes**, this is very important. The crime categories have to be very granular e.g., burglary in public housing projects vs. burglary in an affluent neighborhood.
* **Step 1** -> the decision to rob a house.

* **Step 2** -> Picking a house to rob.

* **Step 3** (not pictured) focuses on why individuals persist in burglary -> increased professionalism, changes in life style and values, changes in peer group.
* **Step 4** (not pictured) desistance -> precipitating events (burglary goes bad) -> re-evaluation of readiness -> external events (married, fence arrested, no more good targets, age) -> reconsider legitimate alternatives or other illegitimate alternatives.

### Section 3: Implications of rational choice models for policy

* Crime is just like any other decision process and human activity.
* Helps focus policy -> What types of crimes are you trying to prevent? Break down the problem into its constituent parts.
* Future research should be crime-specific and focused on individual decision-making processes in the moment but also how criminals consider their careers.
