## Abstract

[Messner and Rosenfeld's (2007)](maumeSocialInstitutionsViolence2003) institutional [[anomie|Anomie]] theory (IAT) has mainly been applied by criminologists to explain crime rates at various aggregate levels. However, Messner and Rosenfeld also suggest that the same social and cultural forces that lead to high crime may explain differences in punishment, although this latter proposition has yet to be subject to empirical testing. Using a variety of data sources for 41 countries measuring various structural and cultural configurations, in this study we assess the extent to which IAT can explain cross-national differences in incarceration. Our results indicate that the strength of the economic institution and the extent of institutional imbalance reflecting a dominant economic institution are positively associated with incarceration rates when the national culture is characterized by individualism, a competitive achievement orientation, or both. A national culture characterized by both collectivism and a cooperative achievement orientation, however, serves as a buffer against the punitive effects of an institutional imbalance that favors the economy. Our results are discussed in the context of the extant IAT literature and future research on cross-national incarceration.

## My notes

### Introduction

Can Institutional Anomie Theory (IAT) explain cross-national differences in incarceration (as well as crime)? The extent of institutional imbalance and the strength of the economy as an institution is positively associated with incarceration rates when the national culture is characterized by individualism. A national culture characterized by collectivism serves as a buffer against the punitive effects of an institutional imbalance or excessive focus on the economy.

### Prior Research

Literature Review -> IAT diverges from Merton by shifting focus onto the balance of power among major social institutions within a society which play a key role in orienting individual behavior toward shared values and norms. Crime results from:

- Social structure characterized by an institutional imbalance in which one social institution (i.e. economy) comes to dominate and diminishes the ability of other social institutions (e.g. family, school, polity) to control behavior. The USA is particularly susceptible to this imbalance because of the American Dream.
    
- Mixed empirical support reflecting differences in measurement of theoretical constructs.

### Hypothesis
  

1) Societies in which sources of informal social control have been weakened by the institutional dominance of the economy will be unlikely to turn social welfare as a means of reducing welfare instead relying on imprisonment.
2) Will ignore costs associated with mass incarceration.
3) Mass incarceration will remain incompatible with countries that stress collective responsibility over individualism (will be concerned with costs and will stress collective responsibility).

	- Some research has found greater involvement of the lay public in criminal justice decision making to lead to harsher outcomes. We see this when compared to bench trials. We see this where judges are democratically elected.
  
### Data and Methods

**Dependent Variable** -> Country-level incarceration rate (number incarcerated per 100,000) summed to include both prison and jail.

**Independent Variables**

1) Strength of four institutions (economy, family, polity, and education).
   
	1) **Economy** -> Index of Economic Freedom (low government spending and low tax burden) and Economic Inequality.

	2) **Family** -> Male domestic time-use data (how much time do males spend doing family household activities relative to time spent doing other activities).
	   
	3) **Polity** -> Measure of civic engagement using Global State Democracy Index. Based on surveys of public involvement in civil society and public policy deliberations.
	   
	4) **Education** -> % of GDP spent on education.
	   
	5) Then measure institutional imbalance as a measure of how out of whack all these different institutions are.

2) National culture is measured along two dimensions (individualism and achievement orientation).
   
	1) Measured using [[Hofstede’s cultural index]] which was developed from surveys given to IBM managers and employed factor analysis to find 4 (now 6) factors which explain a country’s culture or *collective programming of the mind that distinguishes the members of one group or category of people from another*.
	   
	2) Individualism (universalism -> same rules apply to everyone) vs. collectivism and particularism.
	   
	3) Masculinity (achievement, heroism, assertiveness, competition).

**Controls** -> Homicide rate, economic development (life expectancy, GDP per capita, infant mortality rate, % living in urban areas).

Use [[OLS]].

### Results
  
#### Table 2: Mixed results for IAT

- Contrary to what might be expected, the % of the Male Population is negatively correlated with the incarceration rate.

- Homicide rate is positively correlated with the incarceration rate. As expected.

- Strength of economic institutions is positively correlated with incarceration rate as expected.

- Non-economic institutional strength is unrelated which is unexpected.

#### Table 3 & Figure 4

- As institutional imbalance increases, the incarceration rate also increases. This is true for individual & cooperative, collectivistic & competitive, and individualistic competitive. The only group which this doesn’t hold for (and in fact as institutional imbalance increases the incarceration rate decreases) falls is collectivistic and cooperative (seems to guard against this problem).

- This finding even holds when controlling for the homicide rate.

- A national culture emphasizing individualism or competitiveness is sufficient to provide a cultural setting for institutional imbalance (characterized by economic dominance) to promote increased incarceration rates.

### Conclusions

- Finds greater support for the structural dynamics (strength of economic institutions) rather than for the cultural dynamics.

- Find no association between incarceration rates and either individualism or achievement orientation.

- However national culture can moderate the influence of institutional imbalance on incarceration. See table 3 and figure 4.
