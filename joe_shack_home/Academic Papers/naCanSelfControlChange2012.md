## Abstract

The primary goals of this study were to test the long-term stability thesis of Gottfredson and Hirschi's (1990) general theory of crime and to examine the relationship between self-control and [[Social control theory|social control]] over time. The data come from a field [[experiment]] where the “treatment” consisted of an intentional effort to improve the child-rearing behaviors of a sample of caregivers whose children were at high risk of criminal behavior. Caregivers in the control condition were given no such training. The intervention occurred when all subjects were in the first grade (mean age: 6.2 years old), and we have measurements on self-control and the social control/bond for each subject from grades 6 to 11 (mean ages: 12 to 17 years old). Both a hierarchical linear model and a second-order latent growth model identified meaningful differences in the growth pattern of self-control among individuals in the pooled sample and a difference in the growth parameters for self-control and the social control/bond over time between the treatment and control groups. Both findings are inconsistent with Gottfredson and Hirschi's stability of self-control hypothesis. The same patterns persisted when different analytic techniques and model specifications were applied, which suggests that the results are not an artifact of measurement error, model specification, or statistical methods. [[Structural equation modeling]] using the panel design of the data was better able to disentangle the long-term relationship between self- and social control—a relationship that was found to be more dynamic than previously hypothesized.

## My notes

### Introduction

* At first, Hirschi accepted age-graded versions of his criminological theory much like others did. Through the [[Life course theory|life-course]], individuals have more or less attachment to legitimate institutions which are directly related to their propensity to commit crime. Individuals who had been unsuccessfully socialized may be become successfully socialized and vice versa.
  
* Later in [[gottfredsonGeneralTheoryCrime1990]], they reject this view. People with low self-control are likely to stay that way their entire life. Their is stability throughout people's life-course as to how likely they are to commit crime.

* Thus, there are two points of divergence between [[life-course]] views (particularly from Sampson & Laub) and and the self-control views.
	* Self-control argues for short-term and long-term stability in an individual's level of self-control.
		* Self-control is malleable in young age (before 10 years of age) during which the child's attachments and social bonds are very important in incubating self-control. After this period of time, self-control and their attachment and social bonds are less important.
		* Delinquent acts beget more delinquent acts and change the proximate environment an individual finds themselves in. Their internal state is the prime causal variable, specifically their low self-control.
		* Argue that caregivers are the primary teachers of self-control for children. Institutions (schools) and other persons may also play a secondary role, but G&H are skeptical of how much influence they have above and beyond parents, or if they can make up for bad parenting -> since it is likely these institutions and persons will not have the support of the parents in the first place.
		* The stability is relative, though. In absolute terms, an individual's level of social control will change over time. Relative to others, though, in a ranking sense it will not change.
	* S&L argue that self-control at the individual level varies over time and varies in response to fluctuations in their social bonds.
		* Self-control is malleable throughout the life-course and social bonds are an important source of socialization which strengthens self-control throughout the life-course. There will be a reciprocal relationship between the two over time.

### Data and Methods

The current study tests: **1)** the long-term stability of self-control and **2)** using SEM they will untangle the causal mechanisms underlying stability and change in self and social control.

Data comes from the Johns Hopkins University Prevention Intervention Research Center [[JHU PIRC]]. Key feature of this dataset is a randomized experiment was conducted aimed at improving parental interactions with children and improving child management techniques -> designed to instill self-control in their children.

**Hypothesis 1** -> Using [[Multilevel modeling|multilevel modeling]] and [[latent growth modeling]], do subjects exhibit significant variation in their developmental pattern of self-control over time? If slopes are not parallel across individuals or groups, the relative ranking of individuals on self-control measures will change over time.

**Hypothesis 2** -> What role do social bonds play during adolescence and do they explain changes in the level of self-control? Adopts a reciprocal causation model within a longitudinal SEM framework.

Intervention happened in the first grade, but were interviewed at 10 subsequent time points from grades 1-3 and 6-12.

#### Measures

* Uses attitudinal measures of self-control rather than behavioral measures (pros and cons of both approaches). Attitudinal measures may be more accurate reflections of the underlying construct but may be biased in the way all surveys are. The gap between attitudes and actions. Behaviors run the risk of being tautological (G&H never seem to address the tautology concern). So this study, interestingly, uses behavioral measures of self-control provided by the teachers.
	* Impulsivity
	* Hyperactivity
	* Concentration problems
	* Oppositional-defiant behavior
	* Helplessness
	  
* Measure aspects of the social bond over time. Use the Structured Interview of Parent Management Skills [[SIPMSP]] to measure social bond score. (They present two different sets of 5 categories, and I kind of combined them here.)
	* Parental monitoring
	* Discipline & Punishment
	* Reinforcement, Attachment, and Involvement
	* Rejection, Support, and Problem solving

### Results

* **Table 1** -> The growth pattern of self-control is characterized by instability. An individual's self-control varies significantly over time. Furthermore, individuals with lower levels of self-control, at first, gain more self-control at a higher rate allowing for a change in relative rankings.
	* Some individuals also decrease in self-control over time.
	  
* **Figure 2** -> Youths in the treatment group have significantly higher increase in self-control. More evidence for a shuffling in relative rankings.
	* Additionally, individual change in self-control is related to individual change in their social bonds after early childhood. This points to the possibility of a malleable nature of self-control and the connection between self-control and social control.

### Conclusions

* There is variability in the growth rate of self-control between individuals (especially between treatment groups), and the variability is accounted for by changing levels of the social bond triggered by the treatment. Self-control is not relatively or absolutely stable after 10 years of age.
* Points the way forward for how to combine social control and self-control.
