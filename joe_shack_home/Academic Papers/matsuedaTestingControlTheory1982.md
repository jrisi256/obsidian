## Abstract

A number of strong theoretical statements have been based on analyses of delinquency data from the Richmond Youth Project. Hirschi (1969) and Jensen (1972), in particular, found that Hirschi's control theory was empirically supported over Sutherland's theory of differential association. This paper reanalyzes these data and reassesses this negative evidence pertaining to differential association theory. It is shown that the ratio of learned behavior patterns favorable and unfavorable to violation of legal codes, the critical variable in Sutherland's theory, can be operationalized by explicitly modeling its measurement error structure. In turn, this allows the testing of specific hypotheses derived from the theory. The analysis based on this strategy finds differential association theory supported over control theory. Specifically, the unobservable construct representing the ratio of learned behavior patterns successfully mediates the effects on delinquency of the model's other variables.

## My notes

### Introduction

* Paper reanalyzes the data and reassesses the negative evidence pertaining to [[differential association]] theory. It is shown the ratio of learned behavior patterns favorable and unfavorable to violation of legal codes (DA) can be explicitly modeled. The analysis based on this strategy finds DA support over control theory. Specifically the unobserved construct representing the ratio of learned behavior patterns mediates the effects of the model’s other variables on delinquency.
  
* To reiterate, [[Social control theory]] states people deviating should be the given, and we only don’t deviate because of our bonds to society. When bonds are broken/weakend, more free to deviate but aren’t required to do so.
  
* For Hirschi, there are no delinquent subcultures. There is variation in the extent to which people believe in society’s norms and the less the belief, the higher the probability of deviating.

#### Hirschi's Claims

* First, Hirschi finds that the more intense or the more attachment among boys with one or more delinquent friends… the less likely they’ll be to engage in delinquency. As Matsueda mentions, this isn’t definitive proof of the fallacy of differential association. You can learn pro-criminal messages from anyone and anti-criminal messages from anyone. Furthermore it’s the messages you’re learning which are influenced by the friends you hang out with, but it isn’t simply reducible to peer pressure/influence.
  
* Second, Hirschi holds the number of delinquent friends constant and claims other indicators like attachment to parents and school and commitment to conventional achievement all affect delinquency. Again, this does not invalidate DA.
  
* Jensen comes along later and does better tests of DA theory. Investigates if parental control affects delinquency directly (social control) or if it only indirectly affects delinquency (DA) through the learning of delinquent definitions. Same hypothesis tested for delinquent peer groups. To measure availability of delinquent patterns, used official delinquency rates in schools, perceptions of trouble in the neighborhood, number of delinquent friends. Finds that 1) holding DA variables constant (obtained from a survey), parental control variables still decrease delinquency 2) Number of delinquent friends affects delinquency independently of the effect of delinquent definitions (not related to social control but investigating if DA holds).

Basically, the biggest disagreement between the theories is if the **definitions** variable fully mediates the effects of attachment.

### Matsueda's Goal

1. Does measurement error attenuate the effect of DA variables?
2. Can the differential association principle actually account for variations in crime rates according to age, social class, neighborhoods, etc.?
3. Is Jensen’s analysis distortive because it fails to capture more complex relationships amongst relevant variables?

### The Model

* Uses [[Structural equation modeling]].

* Four background variables (age, parents’ socioeconomic status, broken home, perceptions of trouble in neighborhood). Under DA, these variables affect parental supervision and peer relationships and definitions favorable/unfavorable to crime.
  
* Parental supervision and peer relationships themselves go on to influence the definitions. Parental supervision also has effects on peer relationships.
  
* Finally, it’s only definitions which have an effect on crime. In contrast with Hirschi who claims parental supervision and peer relationships have effects on delinquency above and beyond their effect on definitions favorable/unfavorable to crime (in other words, regardless of the definitions they impart, they’ll have an effect on one’s propensity to deviate).
  
* Thus according to DA, when accounting for the definitions, the effects of parental supervision and peer relationships should be 0 on propensity to deviate.
  
* An important roadblock is that a person’s ratio of learned behavior patterns cannot be determined accurately because direct observation of the variables is impossible. Nevertheless, the ratio of patterns favorable and unfavorable to delinquency can be treated as a latent or unobserved variable and observable items measuring definitions can be specified as indicators of this underlying theoretical construct.

### Results

* Boys who are older, who are from more modest socioeconomic backgrounds, who are from broken homes, and who perceive more trouble in their neighborhoods are exposed to more definitions favorable than unfavorable to delinquency (Of course, this isn’t always going to necessarily be the case. Some people, as evidenced by the model not explaining all the variance, are going to have an excess of definitions favorable to following the law despite all this. Goes to the indeterminacy problem of differential association.)
  
* Number of friends picked up by the police has a positive relationship with definitions favorable to delinquency. Thus being older, being in a neighborhood perceived to be more trouble-ridden and being supervised less -> causes boys to acquire slightly more delinquent friends -> increases exposure to delinquent definitions.
  
* Exposure to definitions mediate all the other variables.

### Discussion

* The conclusion is clear: differential association theory is supported over control theory. Some caveats:
	* Need longitudinal data to ensure causal ordering is correct.
	* Dependent variable is of crime, generally, whereas Sutherland said it was specific crime which would be predicted.
	* Cannot generalize self-reported trivial delinquent offenses to make statements about all delinquent behavior.
