## Abstract

With over 2 million individuals currently incarcerated, and over half a million prisoners released each year, the large and growing number of men being processed through the criminal justice system raises important questions about the consequences of this massive institutional intervention. This article focuses on the consequences of incarceration for the employment outcomes of black and white job seekers. The present study adopts an experimental audit approach—in which matched pairs of individuals applied for real entry-level jobs—to formally test the degree to which a criminal record affects subsequent employment opportunities. The findings of this study reveal an important, and much underrecognized, mechanism of stratification. A criminal record presents a major barrier to employment, with important implications for racial disparities.

## Background

* Survey studies are limited in their ability to: 1) determine that incarceration indeed causes employment problems, and 2) what specific mechanisms may be causing the problems.
  
* Current study focuses on the effects of a criminal record on employment opportunities.

## Research Questions

1. To what extent do employers use information about criminal histories to make hiring decisions?
2. To what extent does race serve as a barrier to employment?
3. Is the effect of a criminal record different for Black vs. White applicants?

## Study

1. Used a pair of Black/White testers who seemed similar and were made similar in their fictitious resumes. Each pair would rotate who had a criminal record each week.
2. Job openings for entry-level jobs (required no more than a high school education) were identified in the Milwaukee newspaper (June - December 2001).
3. 350 employees were *audited*. Testers would show up to employment sites and fill out applications and get as far as they could (in some cases even going through a preliminary interview).

### Dependent variable

* Proportion of applications that elicited a callback.

### Independent variable

* Felony drug convictions and 18 months of time served.

### Controls (on the resumes)

* High school education only.
* Steady work experience in entry-level jobs and nearly continual employment (until incarceration) see [[garinImpactIncarcerationEmployment2024]] for discussion on why this may be problematic.
* Ensured both applicants had similar work history profiles despite one incarcerated (non-criminal offender graduated high school one year later).
* In cases where the offender was not explicitly asked about their criminal history, they: 1) reported work experience they gained while incarcerated, and 2) listed their parole officer as a reference.

## Results

* Whites with a criminal record received 17 percentage points fewer callbacks.
* Blacks with a criminal record received 11 percentage points fewer callbacks.
* The callback rate for Blacks without a criminal record and Whites with a criminal records were roughly equivalent.
* Author argues the interaction term for criminal justice involvement and race is larger for Black (although not statistically significant). Qualitatively, they found Black respondents were asked more often about their criminal history.
