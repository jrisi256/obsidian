## Abstract

This chapter outlines some key principles of criminal opportunity, and defines a vocabulary of concepts for use in analyzing variation in criminal opportunity. For parsimony and conceptual clarity, it focuses on adult crime, and property crime, or crimes of gain, though we believe that our framework might be useful for studying other types of crime. The chapter traces a lineage of useful thinking about opportunity and crime. It extends key elements of this lineage into a vocabulary of criminal opportunity and a set of principles for analyzing it. Francis Cullen outlined a road for a fuller appreciation of Richard Cloward and Lloyd Ohlin's trail-breaking conceptualization of criminal opportunity. The notion of opportunity for crime is as old as criminology itself. It appears as a central concept in traditional Anglo-American jurisprudence and in the earliest social science writings on crime. Finally, the chapter discusses some implications of this conceptual template for theorizing criminal opportunity.

## My notes

### Introduction

Crime must be subjectively acceptable and objectively possible. Each one influences the other.

Criminologists consider **opportunity** too narrowly. It’s either held constant, assumed to be ubiquitous, and sometimes simply set aside as a subject for future inquiry. On the other hand, there’s a large body of work which focuses on criminal opportunity but ignores offenders. Views criminal opportunity as **the presence of a physical environment conducive to the commission of crime or a particular criminal act**. It ignores how people construct their own opportunities, though. Where one sees an opportunity, somebody else might not.

It matters to include offenders in theorizing about criminal opportunity because the would-be offender shapes what is/isn’t a criminal opportunity through their definitions, perceptions, decisions, knowledge, skills, and history/biography. **Motivated offenders can create and shape situational opportunities interactively**.

### History

**Adolphe Quetelet** -> Early 1800’s, father of criminology(?). Recognizes that for a crime to occur, motive and opportunity are necessary. The propensity for an individual to commit a crime is linked to their **1)** morality (internal factors) **2)** temptations they’re exposed to (external, situational factor), **3)** the ease with which they could commit a crime (partly external, partly internal).

**Patrick Colquhoun** -? Early 1800’s too. Some environmental conditions are more criminogenic than others, and how opportunities for crime are shaped by patterns of social activity. Specifically, crime opportunities are promoted by the expansion of noncriminal activities, illegal activities feed upon legal activities. The economic and social structures will then play a large role in determining location, type, and quantity of crime/illegal activities.

**Sutherland** -> Found property crime increases during wartime. He argued that opportunities for crime increased as the number of capable guardians decreased. Also ties it into differential association by also arguing that it brought increased opportunities for association with criminal patterns. **Person-situation complex**: 1) Excess of definitions favorable to crime, 2) Person has requisite skills, 3) Person has objective opportunity to carry out the crime. “... many of the reasons why an individual becomes delinquent or refrains from delinquency are adventitious…” Additionally, for Sutherland, objective opportunity is necessary but not sufficient. They have to have the excess of definitions -> Will define the situation as one conducive to crime or not.

Gets into ideas of “criminal capital” (skills, contacts, experience, and resources) are better able to actively create crime opportunities. Better able to be selected into and select others to partake in crime with them. Sutherland got some of these ideas but not fully.

**Cloward and Ohlin** -> Believe Merton (and Sutherland) failed to acknowledge the role of illegitimate opportunity structures. Just as prospects for achievement in legitimate spheres are unequally distributed so are prospects for success in illegitimate spheres. Particularly important to be in an area where **learning opportunities** were plentiful, **not just** objective opportunities to commit crime. Even when not joining groups explicitly for criminal reasons (biker gang), it can lend itself to learning about crime and how to actively create opportunities for crime.

**Edwin Lemert** -> Criminal careers are delimited by **internal and external limits**. Self and social social controls for criminal action. Actors have agency which is constrained by the specific situation as well as the specific structure of society they’re acting in. He stresses it’s a dialectic though, a constantly unfolding process. Because there is individual agency, we are constantly involved and implicated in constructing the situation. Internal and external limits are interrelated, the objective ability to engage in an act can affect one’s willingness to do so. And then vice versa, one’s willingness can cause one to seek out opportunities.

Even in the criminal underworld, your ability to commit certain crimes is going to be restricted by your preexisting social status (age, gender, ethnicity). It will shape one’s selection into partnerships and networks.

Those who are desisting are purposefully (or not) limiting their opportunities. Aging and marriage can cut off ties to networks or lead to skills going into decline. Acquiring a reputation as being incompetent can hurt your prospects too. Hurts your “criminal capital”.

**John Lofland** -> Builds upon Lemert. “Objective availability” and “subjective availability”. Objective availability includes things like opportunity, knowledge/skills, tools, and your network. Furthers the connection between subjective and objective. He argues having a particular skill set, knowledge, toolset, and contact will facilitate particular types of deviance and will make one more willing to engage in it. It tempts you.

**Steffensmeier & Ulmer (earlier work)** -? Extends interrelationship between criminal opportunity and criminal behavior. A willingness to commit crime will make one more likely to seek out the skills on how to do so. One is more willing to do what one is able to do.

Additionally, sexism and racism play a very large role in structuring who can commit which crimes in the underworld. Network effects just like in non-criminal society (women aren’t seen as ideal partners, get passed over, etc.). Even in white-collar crime.

**Commitment Portfolio** -> Describe the total balance of actors’ conventional and criminal commitments, paired tightly with the **criminal opportunity portfolio** (access to criminal opportunity and how it varies across time, space, demography, and position in the social hierarchy). Availability and attractiveness of alternative paths shape structural commitment to crime. Structural commitment, objective opportunities can then feed personal commitment or subjective motivation to continue on with crime. Declines in the availability and attractiveness of crime (e.g. because of age) can erode personal motivation.

### Vocabulary of Opportunity

- **Learning and Performance Opportunities** - Must have motivation and willingness to take advantage of an opportunity to commit crime and must have learned the requisite knowledge and skills to do so. This knowledge includes finding and perceiving those opportunities as they arise. Performance side involves access to places and targets amenable to crime, tools, networks, and resources.
    
- **Openings and Vacancies** - Some criminal roles and enterprises are going to have more openings than others.
    
- **Settings and Contacts** - Kind of self-explanatory.

Learning and performance opportunities constitute and contribute to the acquisition of **criminal capital** -> individual’s capacity to mobilize resources and contacts to commit a crime AND to recognize and exploit opportunities for crime. The **criminal opportunity portfolio** is the collection of an individual’s physical, human, social, and cultural capital. Variation in capital entails variability in your portfolio.

**Civil knowledge** -> Knowledge most people have which can be transferred to criminal ends. Knowledge of store layouts, knowing the mechanics of how credit cards and checks work.

**Preparatory knowledge** -> Familiarity with orientations and techniques of crime acquired by hanging around or being embedded in criminal groups (intentionally or not). Growing up in a neighborhood where drugs are sold on the corner.

**Technical Knowledge**: Mechanical, interpersonal, perceptual.

**Access to Performance Environments** ->
- Contacts and networks
- Tools/hardware
- Suitable targets and places
    

### Principles of Actor-Centered Approach to Criminal Opportunity

1. Opportunity inherently involves agency and choice.

2. Access to criminal opportunity entails learning and performance.

3. **Opportunity shapes willingness. Lines of action which are objectively available can become more subjectively acceptable.** Criminal opportunity influences criminal motivation and vice versa. One is more likely to develop favorable attitudes toward deviant activities when conventional alternatives are less attractive/available and deviant alternatives are more attractive/available. Some idea of a sunk cost fallacy happening here, but also closes one off from conventional opportunities.

4. Changes in criminal/conventional opportunity over the life course are important in understanding changes in criminal trajectories.

5. Conventional and criminal opportunities sometimes intersect and sometimes conventional opportunities/resources can leverage criminal opportunity.

6. Criminal opportunity is, to some extent, necessarily specific to crime types.

7. Crime opportunity portfolios vary across subgroups such as age, gender, race, and social class.

8. Criminal opportunity is embedded in place and time. Opportunity structures vary by place/geography and across time/history. This variation is also group specific. Changing patterns of economic production and consumption create new opportunities for new forms of crime.

**Crime Opportunity Triangle** ->
* Availability (one’s location in society which conditions one’s opportunities).
* Selection (how willing are you).
* Capability (your capital and also your ability to perceive opportunity).
