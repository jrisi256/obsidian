## Abstract

A common complaint about the sociology of deviance, particularly the perspective known as [[labeling theory]] or the societal reaction perspective, is that the field is dead. However, considerable evidence suggests that the core themes of societal reaction work live on in several areas of contemporary scholarship. After identifying and describing three key strands of the early societal reaction perspective, I consider how those strands are reflected in more recent work, much of which does not explicitly reference the earlier tradition. I identify the ways that recent scholarship builds upon and yet extends the earlier societal reaction tradition. I close by describing three trajectories emerging in recent work that should focus future inquiry: the contingent effects of labeling, the causes of gaps between social control discourse and practice, and the diffusion of social control practices from deviants to non-deviants.

## My notes

### Introduction

* **Obliteration by incorporation**:
  
	* Explicit links to the earlier tradition have been omitted, and it has been carried forward under different auspices. The author is arguing the theory's influence has been diffused into a variety of other perspectives and hypotheses and the main strand of the theory has been lost.

	* Lemert, Becker and others are the early modern proponents of this school of thought. Primary/secondary deviation -> push back against psychological, biological, and social disorganization theories of crime.

	* **Original statement of theory** -> We create deviance through our efforts to eliminate it. Deviance is not a quality of an action but a quality of society’s response to actions (shaped by time, place, and personal characteristics). Also emphasized studying deviants in their *natural habitat* rather than through surveys or official records.
	  
* **Criticisms**:
  
	* These early theorists can trace their perspective back to [[symbolic interactionism]]. who were in opposition to the structural functionalists.

	* Criticism soon followed: the theory couldn’t be tested, core concepts ill-defined, argued some of their claims were empirically invalid (e.g. labeling results in subsequent deviance and social attributes of offenders are more important than the actual behavior), political and moral baggage of the theory, leftists say it’s not radical enough, some claimed the theory deemed individual’s actual behavior irrelevant.
  
### Three strands of research

Attempting to link newer research on these topics to their older intellectual forebears (who do not explicitly acknowledge the early labeling theorists).

#### Historical and comparative analyses of the development of deviant labels

The socially constructed nature of social problems and identifying some people as the source of the problem. Focuses on media and moral entrepreneurs. Why do labels emerge and take the form they do?

1. “Medicalization” of deviance or the invention of medical labels for deviants (which expanded into non-deviant behaviors as well e.g. sexual dysfunction, menopause, childbirth). Situates the rise and fall of medical labels within broader changes in the ideology, technologies, and social organization of medicine. Future research -> Knowledge, discourses, rationalities invoked by labeled persons to justify, neutralize, explain themselves and create an identity for themselves.

2. Moral panics.

3. Recently expanded into criminalization: abortion, stalking, hate crimes, and other investigations into how problems are constructed.
    
#### Dynamics and consequences of stigma and labeling.

Goffman’s pioneering work on Stigma is very important here. Big takeaway -> labeling doesn’t produce further deviance. There are intervening processes that themselves generate further involvement (and in some cases desistance).

1. Emergence of the concept of *self-labeling* particularly in mental health. As individuals experience emotional distress, they rely upon widely held understandings of mental illness to interpret their own behavior (rather than being explicitly labelled by outside social control institutions).

2. Moore nuanced theories have been developed improving upon *labeling causes mental illness*. Focus on intervening processes and factors which increase/decrease negative consequences of labeling (individuals fearful of the label, try to keep it secret, etc.) -> negative consequences of labeling are mediated by how the labeled individual responds to being labeled (contingent upon prior socialization and prior beliefs about mental illness).

3. In Criminology, theorists argue there are two underlying processes which affect a deviant’s response to being labeled: identity transformation (do you see yourself as someone who commits crime) and structural impediments ([[Life course theory|life-course]] perspective and cumulative disadvantage) which make it harder to desist (can’t vote, harder to find work, others don’t trust you).
    
#### Operation of social agencies as they process deviants

How do social agencies label certain individuals as deviant, and how they seek to manage deviance?

1. A lot of criticism focused on official statistics -> ignores the organizational processes which led to the production of those official statistics.

2. Normal crimes -> prosecutors and public defenders work together to match an offender’s conduct to an official legal category based on emergent folk understanding -> both parties have a shared interest in routinizing the work -> ambiguity in definitions, individuals have a lot of discretion.

3. Parole agents ignore deviant behavior of parolees unless they see some benefit in being able to control the parolee or to satisfy formal/informal bureaucratic demands. Blends social control plus counseling approaches. Creates cognitive frameworks for the parole agents to adopt and carry out.

4. Focal concerns of courts -> sanctioning decisions made in respect to three criteria -> how blameworthy is the deviant, assess danger of the deviant, bureaucratic constraints (caseload management).

5. Race, gender, and other stereotyped constructions of the individual affect sanctioning decisions. Not even just demographics but nature of past behavior or other stereotypes related to socio-legal status (e.g. being a *drug offender*). So called *pivotal categories*.
    
6. Context of social control decision making is dependent upon broader historical trends and shifts in social control ideology and practices. Technologies and strategies employed by social control institutions reflect broader discourses about government and the moral order of society. The technologies and strategies are united in a common logic -> shared problems, modes of problem formulation, shared styles of thinking -> unites policy and practice.
   
	1. This mode of thinking (very Foucault) finds social control organizations as mere channels for broader discursive frameworks and rationalities. Sites where individuals freely act to put technologies and strategies into practice. I don’t really understand the implications of any of this.

	2. In any case, some criticisms. The most obvious being the gap between governmental rationality and technology vs. actual practices in the field. Future research -> difference between law in the books and law in action.

	3. The labelling process is the translation of social control ideologies to local situations which is contingent upon local practical knowledge, competing discourses, and organizational, environmental constraints.
