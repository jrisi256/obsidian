## Abstract

A large body of empirical research exists that attempts to determine whether or not police discriminate on the basis of race. We investigate whether the methods used typically produce valid inferences. We find that they often most likely do not and that results may diverge from reality in either direction, indicating discrimination when it is not present or alternatively indicating a lack of discrimination when it is in fact present. The reason for this is that tests make assumptions about police behavior that are often implausible. Because of this, the simplest forms of benchmark and outcome tests should not be used, although the problem is more general. We discuss several possible ways to improve inferences about the absence or presence of discrimination, such as employing matching or weighting techniques and using novel, computationally intensive methods.

## Highlighted Notes

### Main Research Question

How can we improve inferences concerning racial bias in policing behavior? Our tests of discrimination are too simplistic. The assumptions get rid of too much of the complexity in our behavior leading to wrong conclusions. In this case, our models are wrong and useless.

We discuss several possible ways to improve inferences” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 141](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF))
	  
* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.2&annotation=HXZAQ4RY) “In the present context, the issue is that simplifying assumptions made about police behavior are likely to lead to faulty inferences about the presence or absence of discrimination. As we show, the most commonly used tests—simple forms of the benchmark and outcome tests—are so vulnerable to the problems of oversimplification that they should not be used. But the threat is more general, as all tests of discrimination face these challenges to varying degrees. The implication is that many of our tests of discrimination are not likely giving us the right answer... ” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.2](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF))

### The Benchmark Test

What would rates of police contact look like if there was no discrimination? Use race-specific risk sets often called the denominator (even if it isn't always a denominator). E.g. Black civilians are arrested at twice the rate of White civilians when adjusting for violent crime. This would mean Arrest Rate / Violent Crime Rate. Because Black civilians have a higher arrest rate even after adjusting for the assumed risk set (violent crime), this is evidence of discrimination.

### Outcome (Hit-Rate) Test

If Black civilians have a lower hit rate or accuracy, this means officers are using something else other than objective evidence to search them (presumably discrimination). Or it takes less (and presumably because it's lesser evidence or less evidence, it's less accurate) to search a Black civilian because officers are primed to believe ahead of time they're more likely to be carrying contraband.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.3&annotation=3TEJ5B9L) “The idea is that if one race exhibits a lower hit rate, this implies that their threshold for being searched is lower, indicating discrimination.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.3](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF))

### Ecological test

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.4&annotation=QGMMGBJQ) “Rather, the racial composition of an area is used as an independent variable to predict changes in the aggregate level of some form of police contact in that area.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.4](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF)) -> Very closely related to a benchmark test.

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.4&annotation=N7TMHWEA) “In this case, an association between the racial composition of an area and the overall level of police contact may not reflect the association between an individual’s race and the likelihood of police contact.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.4](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF)) -> This analysis is particularly susceptible to the ecological fallacy.

### Internal Benchmark Tests & Experiments

The authors like this test because it can answer the question it sets out to answer: Which officers in the department are more/less discriminatory in their decision making?

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.4&annotation=V7R8ALCE) “... internal benchmark test compares the decision-making of individual police officers relative to similarly situated officers” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.4](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF))

Experiments (the sixth test) is also useful because it can answer how race structures the decision making of officers in specific situations.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.4&annotation=UWP7JRID) “Experiments ask how (some aspect of) race structures the decision making of specific individual officers in a controlled setting.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.4](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF))

Yet experiments and internal benchmark tests cannot answer the main question of interest for academics.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.4&annotation=7FYK6WS8) “However, these tests do not address the question of whether there is discrimination in the aggregate at the department level.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.4](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF))

### Definition of Discrimination

Similarly situated individuals of different races are treated differently.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.5&annotation=CMLYLM5R) “In this article, we define an interaction as discriminatory if similarly situated individuals of different races are treated differently. Similarly situated refers to similarity in contextual, behavioral, and individual-level features. The strong assumption here, discussed further below, is that similarly situated individuals have equal probabilities of being engaged in criminal behavior and thus should be treated similarly.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.5](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF))

Can race be a treatment in a counterfactual sense? Most likely not. If one insists on thinking about the causal effect of race, it would be best to describe it as an officer's perception of an individual's race on their decision making.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.5&annotation=9JCIIH4Y) “All that needs to be ascertained is whether similarly situated individuals have been treated similarly. This is a descriptive task that does not require making a causal inference.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.5](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF))

#### Problematic definition?

Because race is a social construct, if we held everything else equal, then there wouldn't really be a treatment because race *causes* or *constitutes* all those things you just held equal.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.5&annotation=VTRJY4QB) “Put differently, were we capable of controlling for everything else, there would be no treatment—no solid-state race—that remained because those features and relations exist in a complex interrelationship that together constitute racial categories as we know them.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.5](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF)) 

Discrimination is a normative questions and thus relies about cultural knowledge and assumptions about what would or would not count as discrimination.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.5&annotation=68XMGM32) “... male and female job candidates are sent out wearing the same dresses: They are not similarly situated candidates but for sex, because sex makes the dress mean something different.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.5](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF)) 

It is a normative question as to what we think it's OK for the police to consider when making a decision. On what factors are we considering individuals similarly situated? No self-evident right answer.

In the footnote, we must also determine if police are ascribing these characteristics proportional to their existence or in a discriminatory manner. E.g. let's say we think furtive movements are a relevant reason to stop someone. We must determine if furtive movements exist in the proportions described by the police, or if they over-exaggerate furtive movements amongst a certain segment of the population.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.5&annotation=WXBY7EQU) “... deciding the dimensions along which individuals of different races need to be similarly situated is not inherent nor self-evident but rather a fundamentally normative endeavor. That is, we must decide whether it is okay for the police to factor something into their decision-making or whether considering that thing is discriminatory.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.5](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.6&annotation=PDHLDSPS) “... whether or not something is discrimination is at its core a normative question rather than a statistical one.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.6](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF)) #highlight 

#### Alternative Definitions

How police or civilians initiate contact may proceed in a discriminatory manner.

1) Any disparities (differences between race in the extent of contact with the police) may be assumed discriminatory under the assumption of past racial injustices, police-caused or not.
   
2) Any disparities can be the result of disparate impact (differences which result from facially race-neutral policies which wind up favoring one group) and thus not discriminatory. E.g. police are deployed based on 9-1-1 calls and 9-1-1 calls come more often from minority areas thus large racial disparities would exist in police contact even if the police operated with no bias.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.6&annotation=6RM4K9PZ) “In particular, comparing similarly situated individuals who have a chance of coming into contact with the police ignores how those individuals and officers got into that situation in the first place, and either of these may be seen as discriminatory.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.6](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF))

For two similarly situated individuals (but for their race), it may be impossible to treat them the same... presumably because the same observable characteristics may be less/more indicative of criminal behavior given the person's race? Because people of different races are differentially involved in different types of crimes i.e. different base rates?

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.6&annotation=NRKGZ48L) “... it could well be impossible to simultaneously treat individuals of different races the same both with respect to their observable characteristics and their latent likelihood of criminal behavior for which those characteristics serve as indicators.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.6](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF))

### The Denominator Problem

How do you define the risk set? How do you define the latent population police officers actually come into contact with? You have to make some assumptions about the group of people they are typically coming across.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.7&annotation=BBZLR3VI) “Although extraordinarily simple, this example illustrates an important, well-known, and surprisingly difficult issue with the benchmark test called the [[denominator problem]]. Simply put, when comparing rates of contact by race it is unclear what the proper denominator should be. For the benchmark test to correctly estimate whether similarly situated blacks and whites are treated alike, the denominator that is chosen must accurately reflect the appropriate risk set. Yet if we do not know the appropriate risk set, the denominator we choose reflects our assumption as to what we think the police are doing, not necessarily what they are actually doing. Choosing the wrong denominator, our inference is likely to be wrong. In this example, the expert assumed the police were either going after people randomly (population denominator) or after criminals (crime denominator), but they were actually focused on street activity.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.7](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF))

It is likely there are multiple steps involved in generating the risk set, and the single number generated isn't the result of one, simple process.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.8&annotation=BDTHFF7T) “First, because simple versions of the test only use one number in each race’s denominator, the risk set must be expressed as one number. But if there are multiple processes generating stops, it is very difficult to use only one number because it likely requires a weighted combination of race-specific risk sets for the different relevant processes.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.8](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF))

We need to move away from simplistic versions of the test that express rates of contact per a single process (like population or crime rates).

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.8&annotation=JTQ3WMBZ) “... even in a world where all that mattered was street activity, a benchmark test that used street activity as the denominator would likely give the wrong answer if the police were more inclined to stop people on some streets than others, i.e., if they policed different margins of the street activity distribution differently. Although neither of these problems is necessarily fatal to the benchmark test, dealing with them requires moving away from simplistic versions of the test that express the rate of contact per a single process that might be generating the stops (like population or crime rates).” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.8](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF))

The ultimate problem is we are making unjustifiable, simplifying assumption about what police are doing and who they decide to stop.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.8&annotation=IU7G9QLW)“ The chosen denominator reflects an assumption about what the police are doing.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.8](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF))

### Other Denominator Problem

If you define the risk set as the criminal population, you are unduly skewing results to not find bias against the higher crime group. The assumption being made here is that police officers only stop criminals. In reality, officers stop innocent and criminal people.  
  
E.g. imagine police officers only stopped innocent people. Why on Earth would you divide by the criminal population? The population in question (those being searched) has nothing do with the risk set (criminal population).
  
Stated more plainly, absent discrimination, why would you suspect the stopped population to resemble the criminal population? The police aren't just stopping criminals. In fact, they are mostly not stopping criminals.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.9&annotation=E9QVY6TZ) “The source of the problem is that the numerator (stops) contains both innocent and criminal people, but the denominator contains only the criminal people.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.9](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF))
  
### Simpson's Paradox

When you disaggregate/aggregate data inappropriately.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.10&annotation=E5FV7Y6K) “Simpson’s paradox refers to the possibility of a pattern exhibited by aggregated data either disappearing or reversing once the data is disaggregated.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.10](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF))

Because more Black civilians live in high-crime areas, even if similarly situated White and Black civilians are treated the same, it might appear as if there is discrimination. While there is disparity, it may not be coming at the hands of the police.

See footnote 17, we might imagine that neighborhood crime rates are mechanisms of discrimination. You must think carefully about your definition of discrimination to make sure you aren't controlling away pathways of discrimination themselves. As the authors argue, for this paper, it's appropriate to control for place.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.10&annotation=88KVYEBU) “Imagine that the police are more likely to come across and stop people in certain high-crime areas, that there are more blacks in high-crime areas, and that the police treat similarly situated (i.e., within the same type of area) whites and blacks identically.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.10](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF)) 

If you aggregate across search types, you're assuming police aren't conducting searches with an eye towards recovering specific types of contraband. They will have different thresholds for conducting a search based on the suspected contraband the individual may have.

Even if similarly situated White and Black civilians are treated the same, it might appear as if there is discrimination. While there may be disparity, it will because the hit rate for guns is lower and more Black civilians are being searched for guns thus it brings down the average hit rate for Black civilians even as the hit rate is the same disaggregated for White and Black civilians.  
  
Why are more Black civilians being stopped for guns? They live in more high crime areas? So as shown in the above example, even if White/Black civilians are treated the same, disparities can arise.  
  
You might show, though, the hit rates are discriminatory if they're different when disaggregated by stop type. You can ask in the first place, though, why are more Black civilians being stopped? I guess you would have to go back to the high-crime area example...

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.11&annotation=SRETYY7F)
  
You are making a mistake if you make the assumption that police officers aren't stopping people based on them being severe offenders are not. In this example, if they are a gang member or not.  
  
So you'd assume that even if similarly situated White and Black civilians are being treated the same, there is discrimination. While there may be disparity, it will because police officers are focused on deterring/arresting/stopping the most severe offenders, who in this example happen to be mostly Black.  
  
Why are most severe offenders Black? We can again point to discrimination, but it wouldn't necessarily be because of the police.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.12&annotation=GQ8T8AZX)

We assume police behavior is the same across some strata of some relevant variable (we might consider a confounder), but that assumption is wrong.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.13&annotation=UB5G7D4S) “When the police behave differently across the strata of some variable, but a researcher’s analysis uses data that ignores and aggregates across this distribution, Simpson’s paradox threatens to give outcome statistics that are inconsistent with reality.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.13](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF))

### Infra-marginality

The data clearly demonstrates Black civilians have a lower threshold for being searched, but it also appears to be the case that the hit rate for Black civilians is higher than that for White civilians (suggesting the threshold for searching White civilians is the one that's lower). What gives?

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.13&annotation=JPVAXWSH) “As can be seen, the threshold for stopping blacks is lower: Blacks that exhibit only furtive movements are searched whereas whites are not.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.13](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF))

Similarly situated Black/White civilians are not being treated the same, however, we think they are because we aren't considering the fact that more Black civilians are being stopped in the most efficient stop category driving up the average hit rate and masking discrimination in the less efficient stopping categories.  
  
However if we did find a lower hit rate in the group with heavier tails, that's usually evidence of discrimination.  
  
In using the outcome test, we're assuming police do not use observable signals in deciding whom to stop.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.14&annotation=PUAP2J56) “The average hit rate is a function of the signal distribution and the search threshold. We want to use the average hit rate to infer the search threshold for each race (Simoiu et al. 2017). Yet because the hit rate also depends on the signal distribution, there is no one-to-one correspondence between behavior at the margins (the threshold) and the average hit rate.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.14](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF))

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.14&annotation=WZHGLSPY) “Because of the different signal distributions across races, the average hit rate does not indicate where the threshold is and actually gives us the wrong conclusion using the normal interpretation of the outcome test.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.14](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF))

### Conclusions

Abandon benchmark and outcome tests! They're too simplistic.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.15&annotation=LWBZ4ENZ) “Thus, to increase our chances of making a valid inference, instead of assuming a certain pattern of behavior along these margins, we want to explicitly model them. However, two of the most common tests of racial discrimination—the highly aggregated versions of the benchmark and outcome tests that the expert in our example used—cannot do this: These two tests can only produce estimates of averages, and these averages are largely unconditional. For this reason, we conclude that these tests are irredeemable.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.15](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF)) 

### Other Problems With Tests Of Discrimination

This example is a little confusing to me, but I think the basic premise is that certain signals will have different meanings when a member of one race exhibits that signal vs. the member of another race. So you have to treat similarly situated members of different races differently to be fair! Oh no!

Of course, statistical discrimination may not be efficient. E.g. if you only used race to stop people, this would be very inefficient leading to a very high false positive rate which could be reduced with slightly more information and even other, better information instead of race.
  
Even if it is efficient, it's discrimination. You're treating similarly situated individuals differently because of their race.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.16&annotation=34XN2T2P) “Ayres (2002) presents a hypothetical example wherein wearing baseball caps is a strong indicator of drug possession for whites but not for blacks, and where because the police treat all hat-wearers the same despite its differential validity as a signal for drug possession across race, there is a lower hit rate among blacks. To produce more similar hit rates, the police would need to treat similarly situated members of different races differently.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.16](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF))
  
* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.17&annotation=UR4NPFYP) “... using race as a proxy for unobserved traits may improve the police’s ability to achieve their goals. Using group-level information to make inferences about individual-level characteristics in an attempt to improve efficiency is called statistical discrimination.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.17](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF))
  
* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.17&annotation=W6H38JJJ) “Is fair policing possible? A recent set of papers has shown that if the rate of offending differs across two groups, then it is mathematically impossible for a decision criterion, e.g., who to stop, to be simultaneously fair with respect to three different fairness principles.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.17](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF)) 

Self-fulfilling prophecies -> individuals (because of race/class differences) anticipate police treating them worse and act in ways which may unintentionally signal to the police they're acting criminally e.g. furtive movements.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.16&annotation=2FQM7WF6) “One example he presents is that if the police focus their efforts on poor or minority communities where they believe there is more crime, they generate crime data that reinforces this belief. If they act on this data, rather than seek out disconfirming evidence, equilibria emerge that disadvantage minorities.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.16](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF))

More typical problems of small and bad data and not using the right modeling tools (i.e. regression and propensity score matching aren't the right tools). -> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.16&annotation=JI9ACTXH)

### Is fairness possible?

See COMPAS vs. Northpointe. They aren't using race. If you want risk scores to mean the same thing across racial groups, you'll have to accept the fact that you'll have higher false positive rates for Black civilians. Because they have a higher base rate.  
  
And then if you do use race to be more efficient, you will be discriminating. This is the below example and above example. If whites exhibit furtive movements because they're criminal and Black exhibit furtive movements because they're afraid, you need to take into account race and treat similarly situated individuals differently because of their race. In technical terms, the validity of observable cues/signals of criminality varies as a function of race.

### Ways forward

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.18&annotation=JS39A736) -> We need to better understand how police departments are trying to combat crime. We need to understand and better model how police actually act.

We need better data, but we shouldn't let the perfect be the enemy of the good since perfect data (getting data on those individuals not stopped).

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.19&annotation=TZJNI3XU)“To model behaviors that may account for observed patterns, it is essential to have relevant, high-quality data. And as our example shows, this data may need to be highly disaggregated, even perhaps to the incident or individual level, to provide an adequate test for the presence of discrimination. Unfortunately, the data we want might sometimes be near impossible to get. For example, when constructing disaggregated benchmark tests for pedestrian stops, it is necessary to have data on those who are not stopped. But because they do not come into contact with the police, it is likely very difficult to get disaggregated information on them.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.19](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF))

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.19&annotation=3WB5DIQA) “Conceptually, it is not clear what incident-level data even means for those that are not stopped or how it could be measured if it was.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.19](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF))
  
* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.20&annotation=Q32WSKA5) “Of course, as with any other test, which variables one matches on is critical to determining whether individuals who are similarly situated are being treated similarly.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.20](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF))

#### Exploiting Random Variation

* They talk about the veil of darkness test -> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.20&annotation=EU26IRNN)

#### Computationally Sophisticated Methods

I think these methods still can suffer from the above problems (i.e., [[omitted variable bias]]), but the computational rigor can lessen them to a certain degree.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HTTI4RFG?page=14.21&annotation=8I8EAS59) “The biggest threat to this assumption is whether the officers know something that the model excludes.” ([Neil and Winship, 2019, p. 14.21](zotero://select/library/items/WTXS6ATF))
