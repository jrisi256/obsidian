## Abstract

This article tests cross-nationally the minority group threat thesis that public sentiments toward repressive crime-control policies reflect conflicted racial and ethnic relations. Using multiple data sets representing France, Belgium, the Netherlands, East and West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Denmark, Great Britain, Greece, Spain, Finland, Sweden, Austria, Canada, Ireland, and Portugal, we examine whether racial and ethnic intolerance—animus, resentments, or negative sentiments toward minorities—predicts greater support for the death penalty. Our results reveal that the respondents were significantly more likely to express support for capital punishment if they were racially or ethnically intolerant while controlling for other covariates of public opinion. These findings indicate that the link between support for capital punishment and racial and ethnic animus may occur universally in countries with conflicted racial and ethnic relations.

## My notes

**Main Question**: Does the minority group threat thesis hold outside of the USA in other Western, European nations?

### Minority Group Threat Hypothesis

- The dominant groups’ opinions are fueled by perceived or actual threats from the minority group. The dominant group fears its advantages are being eroded by the demands of the minority group
    
- Associating criminality with the minority group is a powerful tool in the maintenance of the dominant group's power. It allows for prejudice to be expressed legitimately while also simultaneously preventing other forms of public aid to flow to the minority groups. This all makes harsh punishment necessary.
    
- We see differences in support for capital punishment in the US by race (70% vs. 43%).

The author’s argue that this public opinion divide appears to be fueled by racial intolerance and racism. Americans who harbor racial resentment are much more likely to support the death penalty because they associate crime with minorities. Europe doesn’t have the death penalty, but nevertheless there does appear to be disparities in punishment for minority vs. majority groups.

### Data & Analysis

- Use data from surveys in France, Great Britain, Spain, and Canada. Each survey asked questions about support for the death penalty as well as questions about how comfortable the respondent was around and being with minority groups, how much they supported immigration, things like this.
    
- Additionally use responses from the 2001 Young European Eurobarometer.
    
- Use [[OLS]] and [[Logistic regression]].

### Results

- Racial intolerance has a strong association with support for the death penalty across all countries when looking at the separate surveys for France, Great Britain, Spain, and Canada.
    
- Results replicated across nearly every country in the Eurobarometer. Portugal and Ireland are the exceptions.
    
- Supplementary analyses using the 2006 Eurobarometer survey find punitive attitudes, more generally, are associated with racial intolerance and racial animus.

### Conclusions

- Variation in attitudes among the dominant group driven primarily by racial animus. The authors also find education and political affiliation are also important.
    
- The authors argue this is evidence of a culturally universal finding i.e. the connection between racial/ethnic intolerance and a more punitive criminal justice system.
