## Abstract

Shaw and McKay's influential theory of community social disorganization has never been directly tested. To address this, a community-level theory that builds on Shaw and McKay's original model is formulated and tested. The general hypothesis is that low economic status, ethnic heterogeneity, residential mobility, and family disruption lead to community social disorganization, which, in turn, increases crime and delinquency rates. A community's level of social organization is measured in terms of local friendship networks, control of street-corner teenage peer groups, and prevalence of organizational participation. The model is first tested by analyzing data for 238 localities in Great Britain constructed from a 1982 national survey of 10,905 residents. The model is then replicated on an independent national sample of 11,030 residents of 300 British localities in 1984. Results from both surveys support the theory and show that between-community variations in social disorganization transmit much of the effect of community structural characteristics on rates of both criminal victimization and criminal offending.

## My notes

* [[Shaw and McKay]]’s theory of community [[Social disorganization]] has never been directly tested. General hypothesis is that low economic status, ethnic heterogeneity, residential mobility, family disruption, and urbanization lead to community social disorganization which in turn increases crime and delinquency.
	* The inability of a community to realize the common values of its residents and maintain effective social controls.

* Community’s level of social organization is measured in terms of local friendship networks, control of street-corner teenage peer groups, and prevalence of organizational participation. Variables come from the [[systemic model]] of communities: a neighborhood is a complex system of friendship and kinship and formal and informal associational ties.

* Poverty, residential mobility, and ethnic heterogeneity are correlated with higher levels of crime as mediated (or explained) by three factors. I.e., poorer neighborhoods are less likely to have the ability to supervise children, less likely to have dense friendship networks, less likely to participate in formal and voluntary organizations.
	* Mechanisms of SD:
		* **Ability of a community to supervise and control teenage peer groups**
			* Gangs develop from unsupervised play groups. Socially disorganized communities with extensive youth gangs are expected to also have higher rates of adult crime. No hard and fast dividing line between the juvenile offending and adult offending. Authors argue the two merge into each other by imperceptible gradations.
		* **Local friendship networks**
			* When residents form local social ties, capacity for social control is increased because they are able to: **1)** recognize strangers and are more apt to engage in guardianship (protecting against victimization) and **2)** exert structural constraints on the deviant behavior of residents in the community. Denser networks wherein more individuals are connected to one another result in less delinquency because the individual is subject to the reactions of all members in the network.
		* **Local participation in formal and voluntary organizations**
			* When links between community institutions are weak, the capacity of a community to defend its local interests is weakened. Also weakens local social-control functions regarding youth.

* Model is tested on 238 localities in [[Great Britain]] constructed from a 1982 national [[survey]] of 10,905 residents. Replicated on another sample of 11,030 residents of 300 British localities in 1984. Results support the theory.

* Hypothesis hasn’t been tested before because the data was lacking. But also a reliance upon official crime rates. All sorts of issues with the police and official reporting measures. Self-report and victimization data have become much more prevalent.

### Results

* From Tables 2 and 3.  
* More urbanization leads to less dense friendship networks.
* Everything seems to have strong effects with unsupervised peer groups. The strongest being socioeconomic status (lower SES -> lower supervision) and family disruption (more disruption -> less supervision).
* Weak evidence in support of organizational participation. Only SES strongly, significantly correlated with higher organizational participation. Everything else has small coefficients and are not significant.
* Unsupervised peer groups has the largest association with crime and delinquency. Socioeconomic status has a small coefficient and is never significant which shows the mistaken inferences one can make when they don’t understand what is connecting SES to crime.
