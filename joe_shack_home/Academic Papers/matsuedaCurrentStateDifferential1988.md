## Abstract

With his theory of differential association, [[Sutherland]] attempted to identify universal mechanisms that explain the genesis of crime regardless of the specific concrete structural, social, and individual conditions involved. In this article, I discuss the development of the theory and then assess its strengths and weaknesses. After finding[[ Kornhauser]]'s (1978) influential critique of [[differential association]] theory to be oversimplified and misguided, I review recent empirical tests. I argue that the theory appears supported, but requires additional research to specify the concrete content of its abstract principles. Such respecification will improve the theory's predictions, empirical tests, and implications for public policy. I conclude by proposing several avenues for theoretical and empirical research.

## My notes

### Introduction

* Before, Sutherland we had the multiple factor approach. Criminal behavior is determined by a variety of concrete conditions such as mental disorders, age, social class, race, etc. It certainly was multidisciplinary and open-minded but unfocused, eclectic, and unparsimonious. People thought it wasn’t science but just fact gathering.
* **How to properly build a theory as taught by Sutherland**
	* Use **logical abstraction** which calls for abstracting away from the concrete factors known to be correlated with crime (what do African-Americans, young people, men, etc. have in common).
	* **Differential levels of explanation** or where you focus on one particular level and hold everything else constant rather than trying to explain everything all at once.
	* Finally **analytic induction**, case-by-case search for a necessary and sufficient explanation which 1) defines the universe of the phenomenon 2) formulates a hypothesis to test a few cases out on 3) if the hypothesis doesn’t fit, it’s discard or a new universe is selected 4) continue searching for negative cases until confidence in the hypothesis is found.
* This theory is a general theory of crime. It is useful in explaining distinct differences in culture, techniques/definitions, and associations between different deviant groups. Marijuana users are going to be very different from thieves who are going to be very different from a local youth gang.
* At societal level, crime rates are expressions of the ratio between pro-crime and anti-crime groups or organizational patterns and their relative power in influencing members of society.
* Temporally crime rates change as the differentials between groups and individuals change. It’s always a battle, a dynamic process.
* Whether an individual commits a crime or not is dependent upon:
	* Objective opportunity (of course people, depending on their differential will view objective opportunities differently).
	* Presence or absence of alternative behaviors (this too depends on the person’s differential and how much they’ve closed themselves off from going civilian), certain areas will simply have less access to legitimate means.

### Theoretical Developments and Empirical Research

* “Perhaps the most serious criticism of differential association is that it cannot be tested empirically.” Perhaps… but it’s often hard to test whole-hog most sociological theories. What can be tested are specific hypotheses and empirical implications.
* “Another criticism on safer ground argues differential association, as a process, cannot be observed or measured.” So some people have turned to [[survey]] instruments to measure a person’s learned definitions of law violation. [[Structural equation modeling]]. Covariance structure analysis. Simultaneous equation models -> All are getting at, I think, how we can measure unobservable, latent constructs through observable implications of that construct while controlling for random variation due to the randomness and messiness of human life.

### Theory Revision

* Some have tried to incorporate aspects of [[symbolic interactionism]] and social learning. Others try different variations of social learning theory, too. Aker’s social learning theory, “... crime is initially learned through imitation or modeling, subsequent likelihood of sustaining criminal behavior is determined by differential reinforcement, relative rewards and punishment of the act.” Reinforcement can take a variety of forms. Just watching others can serve as reinforcement.
* Another set of revisions attempts to answer some questions: 1) Where did normative conflict or definitions favorable to crime come from? 2) What are the social-structural elements that influence rates of crime? Delinquent [[subculture adaptations]] (Cohen), denied mainstream success they’ll turn to alternative definitions of success and create a culture around it. [[Cloward and Ohlin]] expand by incorporating ideas of legitimate and illegitimate opportunity.

### Kornhauser’s Critique

* Rejects differential association in favor of [[Social control theory|social control]], [[social disorganization]] and other integrated theories. She finds disorganization-based perspectives to be superior to [[cultural deviance]] and [[strain theory]]. However by classifying differential association under cultural deviance, she misconstrues the theory. Nevertheless, she claims all cultural deviance hypotheses share the same flawed assumptions:

1. Human beings have no nature. They’re completely plastic. **Sutherland thinks we have a genetic base but the specific genetic drive is directed through social forces.**
2. There’s no consensus in society. Laws only reflect subcultural values of powerful groups. Thus modern society, lacking consensus, have degenerated into a war of subcultures. **Sutherland didn’t think modern society was so conflict-ridden so as to preclude consensus nor did he think consensus was the sole source of social order nor did he think laws couldn’t reflect any degree of agreement.**
3. Deviance is completely relative; even the most heinous offenses today are lawful in some other time or place. **Sutherland meant crime is the result of cultural conflict and thus what specifically should be outlawed. (Stealing is always considered wrong but what forms of stealing and how will it be punished).**
4. Lawful or conventional culture and deviant subcultures are equally strong in influencing behavior and socialization is always perfect. **The strength depends on frequency, duration, priority, and intensity.**
5. Behavior is a perfect expression of subcultural values and behaviors are thus never deviant. Only subcultures are. As a result, differential association and social learning can only speak to group differences in crime rates and not individual differences. **Sutherland and modern proponents do not presume people are perfect reflections of all the values expressed in any particular subculture. As a result, individuals will deviate from their group's norms (or not) in direct proportion to the modalities of exposure and how their social learning develops as laid out by Akers.**

* For Kornhauser, Sutherland treats culture and social structure as one in the same. Moreover, they’re treated as constant. Behavior which results from these constants (and the chaotic process of structural and subcultural differential association) is thus also a constant. Because everything is constant (in the sense they all determine each other), the theory is useless. The theory cannot tell us which elements of structure are important, which subgroups will form subcultures, or which subcultures will cause crime. Furthermore, the society that’s left is one with no order or consensus.
	* **Rebuttal**: Sutherland built his model abstractly so it could generalize universally and not be attached to any concrete, historical conditions. In fact, he provides no concrete content. Sutherland, of course, thought learning crime is mediated by concrete elements of social organization that organize communication. They’ll vary across groups, societies, and time periods, but the abstract mechanisms remain the same.
	* The questions of why individuals have the associations they have or where did definitions favorable to crime come from are important. However, they exist at a different level of explanation and so Sutherland holds them constant. Nevertheless, he addresses these concrete mechanisms in his writings.

* Kornhauser ends by attempting to integrate the theories which is fine but often fails to recognize conflicting assumptions. Thus the resulting theory can become a Frankenstein monster of ill-matching assumptions or is really an updated revision on one of the theories rather than a merging.

### Future Research

* Need research which specifies concrete elements of the theory’s abstract principles. In other words, giving the abstract concepts historical content will make them easier to test, make predictions, and make recommendations for policy-makers. Will also make it easier to revise theory and help bring it to life, as it were, revealing the concrete causal mechanisms.
  
* E.g. “What are the important definitions favorable to crime used by certain groups?” or “What components of social structure are most important for sustaining normative conflict?”
  
* “...definitions favorable to crime aren’t oppositional such that they repudiate the legitimacy of the law and make crimes morally correct… legal defenses such as self-defense, insanity, necessity, and mistaken identity are prototypical definitions favorable to crime (and specified in law)... many definitions favorable to crime used by criminals are extensions/generalizations of these legal defenses to fit particular situations.”
  
* Another area of research is a situational theory of crime. While DA can be used to explain criminality in terms of prior life experience, an equally important problem is explaining crime in terms of the immediate situation confronting the individual -> Intersection of objective opportunity, interactions with others, and process by which learned definitions are interpreted and applied. Combined with DA, could help explain transitions in and out of crime from a life-course perspective and help explain the aging effect (role transitions).
  
* Another area of research would examine dynamic changes in differential social organization on aggregate rates of crime and on objective opportunities.
  
* Sutherland did furnish his theory with some concrete historical facts. Traces development of capitalism and industrialization and transition away from older, feudal institutions of social control. Capitalism fostered individualism and materialism and a weakened, hands-off government all of which gave rise to crime. In fact, DA is compatible with Marxist theory of class structure under capitalism. Class conflict is a series of competing interpretations and definitions surrounding conventional norms and laws.
