## Abstract

Rapid growth in the incarceration rate over the past two decades has made prison time a routine event in the life course of young, economically disadvantaged Black and Hispanic men. Although incarceration may now have large effects on economic inequality, only a few studies systematically examine the labor market experiences of ex-offenders. We review the mechanisms that plausibly link incarceration to employment and earnings and discuss the challenges of causal inference for a highly self-selected sample of criminal offenders. There is little consensus about the labor market effects of a variety of justice system sanctions, but there is consistent evidence for the negative effects of prison time on earnings, particularly among older or white-collar offenders. The labor market effects of incarceration are not yet well understood, but prior research suggests several promising avenues for future work.

## Background

* Growth in the penal population has been highly concentrated among young, low-skill, minority men.
* Problem -> "Whereas the aggregate effects of the penal system on economic inequality are possibly very large, causal inference about the effect of imprisonment on labor market performance is difficult... Incarceration may not be undermining the economic opportunities of ex-inmates; it may simply be officially earmarking severely disadvantaged men who would otherwise have poor job prospects..." #quote  #paper_idea #question #incarceration_marks_disadvantage

## Causal mechanisms

* A criminal conviction is a stigma indicating this individual is untrustworthy making employers less likely to hire them but also barring them from certain professions.
* Incarceration erodes the job skills of ex-inmates. There are opportunity costs imposed on these individuals where they waste time in prison rather than learning on the job. There are actually negative costs too since behaviors learned in prison are likely not conducive to gainful employment.
* Incarceration shrinks the person connections of workers making it harder for them to find legitimate jobs.
* From the life-course perspective, [[laubTurningPointsLife1993]] -> incarceration knifes off development opportunities and prevents juveniles from experiencing important milestones in their development.

## Community effects

* The movement of prisoners in and out of communities can dramatically alter the conditions of the local labor market, drastically increasing and decreasing the supply of able-bodied workers (potentially increasing the opportunities for those left behind? but making the situation worse for them upon return?).
* Can affect business formation decisions on a long enough time scale.
* Alters the social networks and norms inhibiting attachment to the legitimate labor market. On return, ex-prisoners find themselves embedded in criminal networks, and their social network has less information about legitimate job opportunities. This will give communities ***negative reputational effects***.

## Techniques for causal inference

* [[fixed effects]] modeling where you compare an individual to themselves before and after the treatment.
* Collect data on a plausible control group e.g., convicted but not incarcerated offenders. This is somewhat akin to a matching strategy.
* Use survey data which has much richer individual-level data which can be included in the modeling procedure.
* Exploit some plausibly exogenous variation in who receives incarceration ([[regression discontinuity]] in sentencing guidelines and [[judge instrumental variables]]).

## Outstanding issues

* Conditions of confinement. Prison and jails are largely considered interchangeable black boxes by researchers.
* Are administrative data and survey data accurately capturing this population of individuals? i.e., individuals who have been incarcerated.

## Overview of results

* They find that incarceration has worse impacts for older individuals and especially for those with white-collar occupations.
