## Abstract

The US ‘War on Drugs’ has had a profound role in reinforcing racial hierarchies. Although Black Americans are no more likely than Whites to use illicit drugs, they are 6–10 times more likely to be incarcerated for drug offenses. Meanwhile, a very different system for responding to the drug use of Whites has emerged. This article uses the recent history of White opioids – the synthetic opiates such as OxyContin® that gained notoriety starting in the 1990s in connection with epidemic prescription medication abuse among White, suburban and rural Americans and Suboxone® that came on the market as an addiction treatment in the 2000s – to show how American drug policy is racialized, using the lesser known lens of decriminalized White drugs. Examining four ‘technologies of whiteness’ (neuroscience, pharmaceutical technology, legislative innovation and marketing), we trace a separate system for categorizing and disciplining drug use among Whites. This less examined ‘White drug war’ has carved out a less punitive, clinical realm for Whites where their drug use is decriminalized, treated primarily as a biomedical disease, and where their whiteness is preserved, leaving intact more punitive systems that govern the drug use of people of color.

## Highlighted Notes

### Research Question

Why didn't methamphetamine go down a similar tract despite being a drug of White people? How much does the usage and purposes of the drug also condition its acceptance and the narrative around its use?

#disagree It does seem very tied to race though. But to Carlos's point, it does seem like the connection and the interconnecting points are murky. They point to the intervening mechanisms somewhat. Connections to capitalism + class, authority structure of the medical profession.

I suppose this comes from victimization surveys. The War on Drugs reinforced racial hierarchy.

### 4 Technologies of Whiteness

4 technologies (neuroscience, pharmaceutical technology, legislative innovation, and marketing). Makes the *White Drug War* less punitive, more clinical (more of a biomedical disease), decriminalized, leaving Whiteness preserved, and leaving intact more punitive systems for individuals of color.

### History

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=2&annotation=QXP4T7CR) “Beginning in the 1990s, rates of prescription opioid misuse – primarily OxyContin – began to rise dramatically, particularly among Whites. The press reported a suburban and rural White prescription opioid epidemic as prescription drug overdose deaths rose 117 per cent between 1999 and 2012. By 2010, the National Institute on Drug Abuse noted increasing numbers of prescription opioid dependent people turning to heroin as prescription opioids became harder to misuse because of new prescription monitoring programs and tamper resistant opioid formulations.” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX))


[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=4&annotation=KL8C9RRX) “... the synthetic opiates OxyContin and Suboxone that gained notoriety starting in the 1990s in connection with epidemic prescription medication abuse among White, suburban and rural Americans... ” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX))

"Exemptions were made for white middle-class participants, not epiphenomenal but constructive." Medicine has been co-opted by whiteness to normalize "racial differences".

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=3&annotation=8IJQEAAH)“The drug war operates because of a reciprocal relationship between the criminalization of blackness and the decriminalization of whiteness. Lassiter notes that, when the Rockefeller Drug Laws instituted harsh mandatory minimums, White suburban youth found themselves facing significant jail time for low-level marijuana possession. Parents of White suburban youth banded together to create policy changes that exempted marijuana from the Rockefeller Drug Laws, essentially decriminalizing low-level possession in some jurisdictions. This was possible, in part, because of the racial dynamics and the portrayal of White youth as sympathetic victims of the organized narcotics trade.” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX))

Race is implicit in the practice of medicine? #question

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=3&annotation=8BYITB23) “These works remind us that racial projects are inherently implicated in medicine and that race is reified in discourses of legitimacy, normativity and technological precision.” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX)) 

Unless racism is explicitly acknowledge, it will wind up reproducing racial hierarchy even against the wishes of the participants.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=3&annotation=LNL29BGS) “White race is encoded into biomedical technologies and practice in particularly covert, implicit rather than explicit ways and in ways that may not be intentional on the part of key actors. Our argument here focuses on racializing consequences of pharmaceutical reason that stem from pre-existing structures of exclusion, inclusion, political pragmatism and industry that over-determine the strategies of scientists, treatment advocates, policymakers and pharmaceutical executives. Opioids in the United States are subjected to a racial biopolitics that constrains available strategies, even to those who oppose social hierarchies and strive to de-racialize drug policy. Efforts to de-racialize any arena of life in the United States, which do not directly address racism, risk reproducing racial hierarchy, because White privilege is typically reproduced by eliminating racial references from seemingly universal policies and practice;” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX))

### Thesis Statement

1) Pharmaceutical industry + lawmakers who are conscious of the symbolic meaning of addiction risk and "legitimate" use of opioids.  
  
2) Liberal doctors seeking to decriminalize opioid misuse and democratize treatment while failing to recognize how this reinforces Whiteness.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=4&annotation=4FQFH4Z7) “Our thesis is that these technologies of whiteness are fueled by two biopolitical currents that trade on hidden or misrecognized racial coding: on one hand, a partnership of the pharmaceutical industry with lawmakers who are conscious of the racial symbolism of addiction risk and legitimate use of opioids, and on the other, an unconscious collusion of liberal neuroscientists seeking to decriminalize opioid misuse and democratize treatment using a discourse of addiction as a brain disease, while failing to recognize the (White) racial coding in the universal brain disease framework and its disparate consequences.” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX))

### Whiteness of neuroscience

This is how it gets framed for Black drug users. It becomes illegitimate.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=4&annotation=WV4AC7NE) “The mass incarceration of people of color for drug offenses is, in part, legitimated by the belief that drug use results from a failure of will or morality. People are responsible for their use and, therefore, must be held accountable or punished.” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX)) 

NIDA is pushing this model in contrast for White drug users.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=5&annotation=SRNYBGB3) “The article argued that drug dependence was comparable to asthma, diabetes and hypertension in terms of heritability, causation, pathophysiology and adherence to treatment, and that it should be treated as a chronic medical illness for purposes of treatment approaches, insurance coverage and outcome measures.” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX)) 

I do not understand this argument. #question 

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=5&annotation=LJIDPRER) “What is striking about brain images of addiction is that they are unmarked by race: they convey a sense of universality and timelessness that, by omitting racial identity, help to expunge racial identity of the addict leaving a White, because racially unmarked, backdrop.” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX))

It seems to me not exactly the fault of the neuroscientists. Perhaps they should have focused more on saying this model applies to everyone for all types of addictions? It seems like it was usurped by other actors to only apply to White opioid addiction.  
  
But, I would hope, a good faith actor would see this is not the case, and good scientists would say, "No, this model should be applied to everyone, regardless of their race." #disagree 

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=5&annotation=FV9N55F9) “The neuroscientific reframing of addiction is, therefore, a technique for the racial recoding of (certain types of) addiction and of (some) addicted” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX))

[[Social determinants of health]] -> very individualized model of health.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=6&annotation=XGW7RPJA) “Neuroscience and whiteness are further connected through the silence in neuroscientific literature about the role of environmental factors contributing to addiction. Social determinants of health, such as geography, income, education and housing are largely omitted from the description of research subjects and from the lists of relevant variables in neuroscientific papers.” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX))

Again, I am not sure why it is the fault of neuroscientists that this model did not get attached to non-White people. Maybe they could have pushed harder? #question 

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=6&annotation=HA526UTA) “When addiction is framed as a brain disorder, rather than a crime, its cultural work to racially recode prescription opioid addiction as White is unrecognized. This ultimately leads to a bifurcated discourse of White addicts as having a ‘brain disease’ and needing ‘treatment’, and of non-White addicts as ‘criminals’ that require incarceration to protect the public.” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX)) 

Sure. I see that critique. It is too individualizing. I might agree, though, it would be helpful to get the public to see all issues of addiction as one that is not a problem of an individual's character.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=7&annotation=9WAVMSXY) “Importantly, both models – the moral/criminal and the medical – root the etiology of addiction at the level of the individual, absenting from consideration structural and environmental factors.” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX)) 

I'll agree it was no coincidence this model was created when White drug addiction became a problem.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=7&annotation=IET6CXZT) “These discussions do not explicitly reference race, but it is notable that the neurobiological, universal, by extension ‘White’ and therefore less stigmatizing and criminalizing concept of addiction, was aggressively developed during a decade (the 1990s) when middle class, White heroin use was growing.” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX))

Perhaps. I see the point. Medical community often does not consider the contexts in which its recommendations take place (think of Righteous Dopefiend and the cutting of abscesses).

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=7&annotation=TCK3UBZF) “The brain disease model of addiction reduces any discussion about poverty, exposure to drugs, racism and other environmental factors to problems of the brain and its response to ‘stress’. Social issues, such as the mass incarceration of African Americans under harsh drug laws or the lack of viable economic opportunities beyond the drug trade in Black and Latino neighborhoods, have no place in neuroscientific discourse.” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX)) 

### Pharmaceutical companies

Drug companies must constantly reassure the public and the government these medications are *medications* and can only be used as promised by people with *legitimate* problems as diagnosed by a real doctor.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=8&annotation=DDKDFCT8) “For example, to justify its widespread use by generalist physicians for the treatment of chronic pain, the makers of OxyContin claimed that its sustained release formulation would prevent its diversion and abuse. When it became clear that, in fact, OxyContin, was easy to abuse by crushing and snorting or injecting it, drug developers at Purdue Pharmaceuticals began experimenting with new ‘tamper-resistant’ formulations.” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX))

Technology can be used as a means of making the drug more efficient, less subject to abuse by unworthy subjects.

On the other hand, drug addiction and abuse is a terrible thing, no? I always feel like I am close to backsliding into cultural relativism. It's hard for my brain to follow these arguments sometimes. It's good we have these drugs? (Well methadone, I am not so sure about. It just seems like a worse version of heroin, in the sense that it does not give you any of the good parts).

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=9&annotation=7AAHLUFC) “While race was not an explicit part of the scientific-political discourse of Suboxone, Campbell and Lovell note the lengths to which Suboxone’s manufacturer went to distinguish it from methadone and to shed the stigma associated with addiction treatment, as it lobbied for the lower abuse potential scheduling of Suboxone, and for its positioning in the 'treatment space' of generalist doctors’ offices, based on its claimed molecular superiority.” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX))
  
The drug itself is the problem not the drug users. -> Whiteness in action. Technological fixes, a problem with the medication, a problem with the brain, a medical problem.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=10&annotation=8Z3NJLGP) “Neurochemistry, not a failure of will or character is the root of the problem, and a neurochemical fix, not prison or a punitive behavioral intervention, is the solution.” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX))

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=10&annotation=WRWFGY6P) “The solution is not to penalize those who misused them, but rather, to develop new technologies and reformulate the medications seal them off from the realm of illicit drugs that are bought and sold on the street and/or injected by ‘addicts’. Inherent in the effort to distinguish licit from illicit drugs is an often unspoken racial symbolism of White biology and Black crime... ” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX))

Congress has forced doctors and pharmacies to become the primary targets of malfeasance (you must carefully monitor your supply and use).

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=11&annotation=9BGFLJBY) “The emphasis of state and federal agencies, including the DEA, on prescription monitoring has made pharmacies and doctors, rather than patients/prescription abusers, the primary target of law enforcement.” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX))

Creating programs for individuals to dispose of unused prescription medication.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=12&annotation=NWFPID2W) “It strains the imagination to picture a similar program aimed at reducing the death and crime associated with heroin use.” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX))

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=12&annotation=P76SSEX6) “In fact, although by 2004 prescription opioids overtook heroin as the primary opiate of abuse in the United States, arrests of prescription opioid abusers and street-level dealers were far outnumbered by arrests of users and dealers of illicit narcotics.” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX))

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=12&annotation=LA8CEHRT)“The White market of OxyContin and related prescription opioids, it was thought, could be controlled through medicalized, sanitized interventions focused on surveying and credentialing pharmacies, clinics and professionals, while leaving the more punitive world of incarceration intact to respond to use of illicit drugs in predominantly African American and Latino communities.” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX))

The crisis happening amongst White individuals led to new changes in how treatment could happen (see methadone vs. Suboxone).

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=13&annotation=JI5JL2A5) “In 2000, the Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA) was passed and allowed any certified physician to prescribe an opioid – Suboxone – in the privacy of their own offices to treat addiction. This remarkable legislative change marked a clear shift away from the ‘war on drugs’ policy and rhetoric that had dominated US drug policy for decades. The policy responses seen as appropriate for Black and Brown addicts – methadone and prison – were not seen as a viable option for White addicts. New alternatives were needed, and DATA 2000 provided them. An analysis of the congressional records surrounding the passage of DATA 2000 shows Congress turning to a medicalized response for addiction, especially for certain kinds of addicts they characterized as young and suburban.” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 13](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX))

Nobody seems to be questioning why this model cannot be extended to minority groups.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=14&annotation=PII6KWWB) “ '... The current system, which tends to concentrate in urban areas, is a poor fit for the suburban spread of narcotic addiction'. Although no scientific evidence supported the claims that Suboxone was more effective among new opioid users than for ‘hardcore’ users, this assumption was taken for granted in the congressional record. A corollary to the notion that young, new opioid users would do better on Suboxone was the idea that these same addicts should not be exposed to the stigmatized world of methadone... ” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX))

These will be mild to moderately addicted persons with the financial resources to obtain access to a physician or other healthcare provider who will either dispense or prescribe the medication. The bill does not address the need of most heroin addicts; namely, those who are severely addicted or who lack the financial resources to see a doctor.''” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX))

Racial hierarchy.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=15&annotation=TP573747) “Presumably, DATA 2000 could have, and perhaps should have, changed the landscape for all opioid users, not just White ones. However, as presaged by the legislators above, DATA 2000 had the effect of creating two tiers of treatment.” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX))

Expensive and doctors had to go through a lot of training to be able to prescribe it.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=15&annotation=WRYZ473Q) “Pharmaceutical regulations and reimbursements, therefore, direct buprenorphine to uniquely affluent, White markets building in an invisible but enduring racial bias (see also, Braun, 2014).” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX)) 

Pharmaceutical companies see lucrative opportunities in expanding the market.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=16&annotation=FVIS8UJN) “Rather than focus on acutely ill hospitalized or debilitated patients – those who were traditionally offered opioids for pain – Purdue used this designation to market OxyContin among primary care providers with patients who had lower back and other chronic pain. To create this new, larger and therefore lucrative market of patients with moderate, chronic pain, Purdue hired a cadre of 671 drug representatives who canvassed a call list of up to 94000 physicians, with a focus on primary care physicians, leading to a 10-fold increase in prescription of OxyContin for moderate, chronic pain.” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX))

Press covered Oxycontin addiction very differently. The technological fix also secured their market power.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=17&annotation=IFKF5ZUU) “Their marketing efforts moved from their original extended release tablets – no longer on patent – to new tamper-resistant, patented formulations that had the potential to shut incoming generics out of the market. By keeping prices high, and preserving the image of OxyContin as technologically sealed off from illegitimate use, the manufacturer strove to keep OxyContin symbolically a step ahead of darkening street markets.” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX))

### Conclusion

 Insane. How are we so fucked up.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8G9MDLAW?page=18&annotation=7CZV3P43) “... political work is required to keep White opiates out of the War on Drugs and maintain them in a White medicalized space. The constant threat of miscegenation and invasion requires marketers, legislators and manufacturers to stay one step ahead of the darkening of the drug; they ultimately fail and have to (re)invent new White opioids.” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 18](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX))

As a result, buprenorphine was widely adopted among primary care doctors serving poor communities, who encountered no certification requirements or prescribing restrictions (Lovell, 2006), and the opioid overdose rate in France dropped 80 per cent in the 7 years after buprenorphine’s approval.” ([Netherland and Hansen, 2017, p. 18](zotero://select/library/items/5HJ5GWAX))
