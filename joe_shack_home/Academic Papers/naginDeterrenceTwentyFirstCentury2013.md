## Abstract

The evidence in support of the deterrent effect of the certainty of punishment is far more consistent than that for the severity of punishment. However, the evidence in support of certaintyâ€™s effect pertains almost exclusively to apprehension probability. Consequently, the more precise statement is that certainty of apprehension, not the severity of the ensuing legal consequence, is the more effective deterrent. This conclusion has important policy implications among which are that lengthy prison sentences and mandatory minimum sentencing cannot be justified on deterrence. There are four major research gaps. The first concerns the mechanism by which police affect perceptions of the probability of apprehension. The second concerns the inextricable link between the deterrent effect of the threat of punishment and the potentially criminogenic effect of the experience of punishment. The third concerns the concept of a sanction regime defined by the sanctions legally available and how that legal authority is administered. Theories of deterrence conceive of sanctions in the singular, not the plural, and do not provide a conceptual basis for considering the differential deterrent effects of different components of the sanction regime. The fourth involves sanction risk perceptions. Establishing the link between risk perceptions and sanction regimes is imperative; unless perceptions adjust, however crudely, to changes in the sanction regime, desired deterrent effects will not be achieved.

## My notes

### Introduction

1. Does punishment prevent crime?
	1. [[Incapacitation effect]].
	2. [[Specific deterrence]].
	3. [[General deterrence]] -> focus of this paper.
	4. Also important to think about:
		1. [[absolute deterrence]] -> difference in the crime rate between the proposed policy and having no sanction.
		2. [[marginal deterrence]] -> difference in the crime between the proposed policy and the status quo.
	   
2. How does punishment prevent crime?
	1. If solely through incapacitation, then to reduce crime imprisonment must rise.
	2. If through general deterrence, crime can decline while incapacitation does necessarily have to.
	   
3. Conclusions
	1. Increases in the length of already long prison sentences do not yield sufficiently large deterrence effects to justify their social and economic costs.
	2. There is little evidence of a specific deterrence effect of imprisonment compared to noncustodial sanctions like probation.
	3. Third, there is substantial evidence that increasing the visibility of the police by hiring more officers and allocating existing officers in ways which heighten the risk of apprehension has a general deterrent effect -> backed up survey research which finds that perceived certainty of punishment is associated with reduced self-reported or intended offending.
	4. Certainty of punishment is more important for general deterrence than severity of punishment -> specifically the probability of apprehension given the commission of the crime (not necessarily the probability of prosecution given apprehension).
	5. Lengthy prison sentences cannot be justified on the basis of [[Deterrence theory|deterrence theory]].
	6. Crime prevention would be enhanced by shifting resources from imprisonment to policing.
	   
4. Gaps
	1. Certainty of apprehension by the police. How does it work exactly?
		1. Efficacy in apprehending perpetrators of a crime i.e., deterrence has failed. Thus, deterrence is achieved for future criminal offenders. **Nagin argues this role of policing finds high-risk individuals and incapacitates them**. -> no evidence of deterrence through this mechanism.
		2. Effect of the intensity of police presence in creating a perception that apprehension risk is sufficiently high that no crime is committed in the first place. **Nagin argues for this mechanism**. Links to [[Routine activity]].
	2. Specific vs. general deterrence. How does the experience of punishment (specific deterrence) influence the deterrent effects of future threats of punishment (general deterrence)? E.g., are you more likely to commit crime in the future due to stigma and labeling? Sustained contact with criminals? <mark>Will require longitudinal data on individuals who do and do not have the experience of punishment.</mark> #highlight #paper_idea 
	3. Sanction regimes -> the type of sanctions legally available (fines, community service, imprisonment, execution) for various types of crime (what factors are considered legally relevant e.g., prior record) and how the sanctions are administered (how often certain options are used and how swiftly they are used) -> sanction regimes determine certainty, severity, and celerity of punishment.
		1. Deterrence research needs to focus in on how a harsher punishment (or a less harsh punishment) is more or less deterrent compared to what specific sanction regime already in place.
		2. #data_issue -> infrastructure in place in the USA for crime statistics is rudimentary. We do not have adequate data (at even the state level) concerning sanction regimes in the USA. The best data we have comes from [[BJS]] and the National Corrections Reporting Program [[NCRP]] -> annual data on sentences for people admitted and time served for those released along with individual-level demographic information -> data is very incomplete.
	4. Sanction risk perceptions -> "... the conclusion that crime decisions are affected by sanction risk perceptions is not sufficient to conclude that policy can deter crime. Policy cannot directly manipulate perceptions... Unless perceptions adjust, however crudely, to changes in the sanction regime, the desired deterrent effect will not be achieved." #quote (pg. 7 of PDF, 204 of document).
		1. Agrees that surveys have found people have generally poor knowledge of sanction regimes.
		2. Argues, though, that detailed knowledge of the potential legal consequences is unnecessary. People are deterred from crime by simply knowing the behavior is not allowed and being afraid of legal and social repercussions.
		3. However, there are some individuals for whom sanction threats might affect their behavior, and we do not know how individuals form perceptions of the sanction regimes they confront.
		4. Where do perceptions come from since they do not seem to have a large basis in reality?

### Model

* Probability of successful completion versus:
	* Probability of unsuccessful completion and not being apprehended.
	* Probability of being apprehended.
	* Probability of being convicted (conditional on being apprehended).
* Rewards of crime (material, social, and personal).
* Opportunity costs (what could you have been spending your time on instead).
* Apprehension + conviction costs (material, social, and personal).

### Literature Review

#### Early deterrence research

* Deterrence research really began in the late 1960s.
	* Growing availability of data and computing power.
	* Crime was perceived as a growing social problem.
	* Intellectual currents at the time see [[beckerCrimePunishmentEconomic1968]].
	  
* Three types of early studies from the 1960s to the 1980s:
	* Experimental + quasi-experimental: See [[berkDeterrentEffectArrest1992]] or [[hot spots policing]]. **Good studies**!
		* Certainty is more important.
		* Severity and certainty are intertwined. Sometimes police, prosecutors, judges, and juries will be less likely to find fault when penalties are high.
		* Deterrence is primarily a perceptual phenomenon with a temporal component. 
	* Aggregate-level -> analyze association of crime rates across geographic units with measures of certainty and severity of punishment. Generally found negative associations between crime rate and certainty of imprisonment. **Flawed studies!**
		* Do not distinguish between deterrence and incapacitation.
		* Cannot distinguish between cause and effect. Are high incarceration rates causing high crime rates?

#### Capital Punishment

* Capital punishment -> Needs its own category given how contentious the research is around this topic. Nagin basically argues the research is not good enough, at least for determining policy, to determine if capital punishment has a deterrent effect.
	* Problems -> Capital punishment is deterrent compared what? Studies never made it clear what they were comparing capital punishment to.
	* Did not have access to offender perceptions of arrest, conviction, and execution -> cannot assume they have accurate perceptions (which some studies did).
	* Not straightforward to calculate the risk of execution (where different ways of calculating the risk can change results).

#### Deterrence research in the 1990s

* Deterrence research in the 1990s:

	* **New Wave of Aggregated Level Research**
		* Used longitudinal data and did not attempt to parse out differences in certainty and severity and just focused on prisoners per capita. Generally find negative associations between imprisonment and crime although magnitudes varied widely.
			* Again, these studies cannot distinguish between incapacitation and deterrence.
			* Again, reciprocal causation and feedback loops -> you need an [[instrumental variable]]. Only a handful studies used an instrumental variable.
				* Even these studies have problems. One is that the instrumental variable approach severely, severely limits one's ability to generalize one's findings and make policy recommendations.
				* Second, they again cannot distinguish between incapacitation and deterrence.
			* Incarceration rates are not measures of severity and certainty.

	* **Policy Evaluation Studies of Sentence Enhancements**
		* Certain but non-draconian sections were found to be successful in deterring crime.
		* Making an already existing punishment more severe does not seem to do much to deter crime.
			* Criticizes [[levittJuvenileCrimePunishment1998]] for not being able to parse out incapacitation effects since the data is at annual frequencies, the data is not measured at the individual level so there is [[aggregation bias]] potentially, and also, in general, only having data available annually makes it hard to discern changes at the boundary of becoming an adult. Points to other studies which are better.
		* Thus, Nagin concludes there are diminishing returns to severity. The overall establishment of a punishment (versus no punishment) has strong deterrent effects. However, increasing the severity of punishment achieves smaller and smaller reductions in crime.

#### Police and crime

* Panel data sets of US cities comparing crime rates to measures of police expenditures and number of police per capita.
	* Larger resource commitments to the police are associated with lower crime rates. See [[durlaufImprisonmentCrime2011]] for important limitations.
		* Cannot distinguish between incapacitation and deterrence.
		* Assumes the effect of police levels on crime is constant across time and place -> policing strategy matters and there are better vs. worse ways to deploy the police to achieve more or less crime reduction.
* Studies which examine changing levels of policing due to plausibly [[exogenous shocks]] e.g., changing terror alerts.
	* Finds declines in policing activity are associated with increases in crime.
	* Putting more officers on the street has a substantial deterrent effect on crime.
	* No evidence of crime displacement.
		* #highlight <mark>Need long term evaluation on hot spots policing to really determine this.</mark>
* Policing strategy matters.
	* Rapidity of response or thoroughness of post-crime investigation -> not shown to be effective.
	* Nagin argues deterring crime from happening in the first place is the primary benefit of policing rather than increasing apprehension risk for a crime that has happened already.
	* [[hot spots policing]] in particular -> create a high risk of apprehension in those areas where lots of crime occurs thus stopping that crime from ever happening.
	* Less consistent but still credible effects found for [[problem oriented policing]].
	* Talks about [[Ceasefire program]] in Boston -> drastically increase certainty and severity by routinely telling gang members they are being watched. Work needs to be done to understand the mechanisms by which this program worked and how well it might generalize.

#### Perceptual Deterrence

Analyzes association between perceptions of sanction risk (whatever their source) and self-reported illegal behavior or intent to engage in illegal behavior.

* Moderated by criminal involvement and perhaps other factors.

* Use cross-sectional surveys, longitudinal studies, and scenario-based studies.

* Typically find actual or projected offending is negatively related to perceptions of sanction certainty despite limitations (generalizability from the sample especially for samples of juveniles, how well can respondents quantify their risk perceptions, do our questions prime responses).
  
* Respondents are also very concerned about the informal costs or societal reactions.
	* Those with higher stakes in conformity are more deterred.
	* Also fears of stigma (e.g., not being able to find work).
	* Suggests fears of arrest are greater than the actual cost of the formal sanction.
	  
* However, deterrence-based policies based on fear of stigma may not work in the long-run depending on how many people become stigmatized -> only works if the stigma is selectively applied.

#### Sanction Risk Perceptions

* Surveys of the general public's knowledge of sanction regimes.
	* Generally, not good. Sometimes is **relatively** OK in understanding that more severe crimes have more severe punishments. Knowledge of risk of apprehension is quite low.
	* Populations which are more at-risk of certain types of crimes (e.g., marijuana possession) have *slightly* better knowledge, but it is still not good.
	* Criticizes [[kleckMissingLinkGeneral2005]]
		* People are not going to commit the serious crimes they outlined so why should they know the risks of getting caught.
		* <mark>The ratios of getting caught suffer from the fact that they only measure criminal impulses which were acted on, and they do not count those criminal impulses which were not acted on.</mark> #highlight 
		* <mark> Arrests per crime at the county or city level are poor levels of risk at the specific locations where crime happens.</mark> #highlight 
* Studies on the effects of apprehension on risk perception and subsequent behavior.
	* [[Bayesian estimation]] really lives here.
	* Being apprehended results in a slightly upward shift in risk perception.
	* The magnitude of change will depend on the depth of prior knowledge i.e., those with more experience will make smaller adjustments based on current experience.
