## My notes

### Introduction

* Since 1972, the rate of incarceration in the USA in state and federal prisons has increased every year.
  
* Policies which reduce **both** **crime** and **punishment** avoid the costs of crime but the costs of administering the punishment. The authors argue crime, prison costs, and imprisonment numbers can be reduced if we shift our focus from severity to a more effective use of the police.
  
	* Increase the riskiness of crime by making apprehension more certain both objectively and subjectively for offenders.
	  
	* Increase the swiftness with which punishment would be doled out.
	  
* In short, they argue the bulk of criminal justice funding should be reallocated from prisons to the police. This is because deterrence-based policy yields a double benefit in that it avoids imprisonment costs, and it reduces crime. It is more cost-benefit effective, potentially.
	  
* This policy recommendation is based on several facts:
  
	* The marginal deterrent effect of increasing already lengthy prison sentences is modest at best (stated another way the deterrent effect of more severe punishments at current levels of certainty are severity are not helpful while more certainty even at the expense of less severity would be helpful):
	  
		* The empirical support for deterrence generally finds certainty to be the most important factor rather than severity.
		  
		* Empirical support for general deterrence (threat of punishment, group-based) is stronger than specific deterrence (experience of punishment, individual-based but can also be group-based).
		  
		* **Limitation**: The research is mostly focused on the effect of marginal deterrence. I.e., how does increasing already long sentences affect deterrence? There is likely a non-linear relationship between deterrence and severity where short and certain incarceration spells do seem to deter.
		  
	* Increasing the visibility of the police by hiring more police officers and by allocating existing officers in ways which heighten the objective and subjective risks of apprehension have substantial marginal deterrent effects.
	  
		* Discuss an important distinction between the perceived probability of punishment for individuals who committed crimes (captured by the clearance rate) vs. the perceived probability of punishment for individuals who thought about committing a crime but ultimately did not.
		  
			* Captures how deterrence might work when played out through the increase in police presence.
			  
		* Thus because crime is more risky, the pool of potential offenders is reduced which reduces the amount of crime (they are deterred), and then because less people are offending, there are less people to imprison which reduces the imprisonment rate.
		  
	* The experience of imprisonment as compared to non-custodial sanctions does not appear to have deterrent effects. If anything, incarceration is likely criminogenic.
		* Increases their skills.
		* Increases feelings of resentment.
		* Strengthen identification with a deviant identity.
		* Stigmatize the individual both psycho-cognitively but also socially and economically.
	  
* **Limitation 1**
	* Attention in this article is focused on changes in ***sanction policy*** which have the potential to reduce imprisonment and crime. Imprisonment and crime could be reduced in cost-beneficial ways by making greater investments in non-sanction related policies.
	* The mechanics of shifting resources from imprisonment to policing are institutionally difficult because imprisonment funding usually comes from state and federal budgets while the police are funded locally.
		* Need a government research apparatus, as well, to better understand what the best policies and funding structures are.
	* Shifting resources out of the criminal justice system entirely into other activities like education or early childhood development poses far more daunting institutional and political challenges.

* **Limitation 2** -> Their analysis does not consider incapacitation effects.

### Empirical Review

* Skeptical of the literature which examines, through regression analysis, the relationship between aggregate imprisonment and crime rates.
  
	* Fail to identify how other policies happening at the same time jointly affected crime and imprisonment. Prison populations are an outcome of the overall sanction policy (i.e., severity and certainty), and they themselves are not a policy variable. 
	* Deterrence responses to changes in severity and certainty depend on their current levels. Thus, there is heterogeneity in deterrence.
	* Logically, the authors demonstrated how you can have a falling crime rate and imprisonment rate.
	* The authors of these studies have failed to consider what levels of severity and certainty produced the observed incarceration and crime rates and how changes in those levels might flip their observed negative correlations.
	* Studies are not causal and other statistical issues.
	  
* Also skeptical of the literature which examines the relationship between measures of police level and crime.
	* Generally find higher levels of policing resources is associated with lower crime rates.
	* Subject to some of the same critiques as above. However, the causality and statistical critiques stick more. Authors think the question is a valid one.
	  
* Most confident in the literature which examines the deterrent effect of specific policies or interventions.
  
	* One could call them natural experiments. In this review, I do not think they outline, though, how counterfactuals are constructed.
	  
	* Making severe sentences already more severe has modest deterrent effects at best.
	  
	* Meanwhile, increases in police presence and activity is associated with substantial decreases in crime.
	  
		* Deterrent effects from rapid-response teams or *more effective policing* due to more arrests or *preemptive policing* which allows officers more discretion in whom to arrest and generally leads to arrest-first policies have not been shown to be consistently effective in reducing crime.
		  
		* Meanwhile, deterrent effects from activities like hot-spots policing and monitoring of monitoring of probationers seem to be effective in that they deter would-be offenders from committing crime in the first place (either by monitoring high-risk areas or high-risk individuals).
		  
		* Problem-oriented policing is ill defined but has generally been found to be modestly effective.
		  
		* In conclusion, effect sizes vary across intervention type which is important because police-related deterrent effects are heterogeneous. Not all strategies are effective. They are highly dependent on how the police are used in the circumstances they find themselves in. But they almost always appear to deter crime.
	
	  * Return to an earlier point, where they find that certain but non-draconian (debatable given that the punishments were stints in prison) had high success rates in incentivizing the payment of court-ordered fines and in helping probationers avoid being imprisoned.
	    
		  * [[Project Hope in Hawaii]] was an experiment where some probationers were randomly assigned to more frequent drug testing which would result in short but certain periods of confinement -> found it led to lower rates of positive drug tests, less missed appointments, and less likelihood of being arrested and imprisoned.
		    
		  * Also important to emphasize that some programs really did have draconian punishment policies, but the emphasis was on the certainty of punishment.

### Policy recommendations

* More severe sentencing laws are hard to justify on deterrence-based or crime-prevention grounds. They might be justified on grounds of incapacitation or retribution lines.
	* Skeptical of the incapacitative effects for older criminals.
	* Additionally, for incapacitation to be effective, individuals must be identified with good enough accuracy who would be good candidates for incapacitation and an accurate sentence should be able to be crafted. It should be a targeted procedure not the blanket policy that mass incarceration is.
		* Is this technically possible? Hard to say.
		* Nevertheless, it is possible that incapacitation might undermine a deterrent-based argument to reduce sentences for young offenders.
	* The ethical arguments along retributive grounds are also shaky at best.
	  
* Resources should be shifted from incarceration into policing.
	* More effective probation and parole supervision services.
	  
* It is hard to make specific recommendations around what to do with those resources once re-allocated since it will depend on the specifics of the police department and the community.
	* Generally speaking, non-strategic preventative patrols, rapid response calls for service, and improved investigation methods are not effective.
	* Hot spots policing is effective.
	* Problem-oriented policing has shown promise.
	* Again, there is much heterogeneity in policy outcomes, though, and there is much uncertainty concerning how well findings will generalize.
	  
* Need better cost-benefit analyses which better capture the social costs of imprisonment policy but also on heightened police presence.
  
* Need to better understand those situations in which severity can be an effective deterrent. How to best balance carrots and sticks.
  
* Cross-national research to understand the crime policies of other nations which have achieved low crime and low incarceration and the strategic use of the police.
  
* Need to better understand how an increased police presence leads to changes in offender perception of apprehension.
  
* More studies needed on the deterrent effects of sentence length and changes in sentencing law.
	* Dose-response relationship between length of imprisonment and offending rate.
	* How the experience of incarceration affects perceptions of risk.
	* How might incarceration be criminogenic.
	* Estimating the effect of re-offending on different non-custodial sanctions.
	  
* Policy research needs to embrace the heterogeneity of policy and local contexts of jurisdictions are important. A portfolio of effective policies should be presented to local actors, having local knowledge not available at the level of research, who can exploit their local knowledge to choose the best policy.
  
* The policy should take into account the incentives of local actors (e.g., police, prosecutors) to ensure they act in such a way so as to maximize policy efficacy.
