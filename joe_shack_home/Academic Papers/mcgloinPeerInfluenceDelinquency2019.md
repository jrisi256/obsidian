## Abstract

Peer influence occupies an intriguing place in criminology. On the one hand, there is a long line of theorizing and empirical work highlighting it as a key causal process for delinquency. On the other, there is a group of theoretical skeptics who view it as one of the most notorious examples of a spurious link. After discussing these perspectives, this review takes stock of our intellectual advancements in understanding peer influence over decades' worth of research toward this endeavor. We conclude that although there have been important gains, essential questions and gaps remain. Toward this aim, we offer some lines of future work that we believe offer pathways to yielding the greatest added value to the discipline.

## My notes

* Much of the work of the past fifty years has been in response to Travis Hirschi's skepticism of the role peers play in offending.

### Background

* **Normative Influence**: Deviant peers socialize the acceptance of delinquent values and behaviors. #da_social-learning_theory #symbolic_interactionism 
	* **The learning perspective**: You learn messages of pro or anti-deviance.
	* **The symbolic interaction perspective**: Delinquent peer association are likely to influence one's formation of identity and whether or not one views one's self as deviant or not. Colors how one views situations and perceives of opportunities.
* **Situational Perspective**: There is an immediate impact in hanging out with your peers in terms of the increased opportunities (and rewards) afforded to engaging in deviant behaviors regardless of whether or not your peers are delinquents or not. #routine_activities Motivations for crime can be found in the immediate situation (i.e., we are bored) -> unstructured and unsupervised socialization among juveniles.
* **Social control**: Largely critical of the peer influence literature. #social_control Believe that peer-based risk factors is the result of social control and/or self-control. Peer variables are spurious. They are the result of individuals self-selecting into peer groups (which is based on their self-control and attachment to legitimate institutions).
	* One strong rebuttal of of this perspective came from the Giordano camp where they found no differences in how delinquents and non-delinquents felt about their friendships as it related to caring and trust. Control theorists argued that delinquent friendships should be cold and brittle given their deviant ways (low value placed attachment, trust, and support).
* Matza and Thornberry argue for a **yes and** approach wherein selection and socialization are important. Individuals with weak attachments or who live in disadvantaged areas may see deviance as more of an option. The peer groups they associated with (and how they interact with them) can provide/more or less motivation to act in deviant ways as well as teach them how to act deviant.

### Questions

1. Do peers cause an individual to become more/less delinquent?
	1. Very few true lab experiments although the ones that do suggest strangers in the lab can induce individuals into deviant behavior.
	2. Nearly every observational quantitative study has found a significant and positive relationship between peer offending and self-offending.
	3. Longitudinal studies suggest that deviant peer association precede delinquency. Of course, they are interactional, and we do not have perfect data going back to birth for every individual. Nevertheless, exposure to delinquent peers at time 1 predicts self delinquency at time 2.
	4. How do we properly measure peer offending? For a long time, we were plagued with individuals reporting on the perceived delinquency of their friends which invites bias (project your own deviance onto your friends). Surely cause for some concern, and using your friends' own self-reported delinquency is better, but it is not like using the objective measures caused the results to flip (just attenuate).
		1. Perceived delinquency is still important because one's own perceptions of the world (regardless of it they are true or not) is important for making sense of the agent's actions because your perceptions drive your own actions.
	5. How to account for selection?
		1. Control for other theoretically important social control variables.
		2. Lag your dependent variables when you have longitudinal data.
		3. Fixed effects models (control for time-stable, person-level, unobserved heterogeneity).
		4. Use stochastic actor-based analyses (with social network data) to account for network-based processes (like reciprocity).
		5. Meta-analyses have found most observational studies to be pretty robust to omitted variable bias (would have to be missing a very important variable).
2. What are the mechanisms connecting peer variables to self offending variables? (If there is a causal connection).
	1. [[haynieReconsideringPeersDelinquency2005]] -> unstructured and unsupervised socializing time with peers regardless of whether or not they are delinquent.
	2. Is it what peers think (i.e., their attitudes, more differential association) or is it what peers do (i.e., their actual behavior, more social learning) that matters for individual behavior? Mixed results.
	3. Much work has been done demonstrating complex social network effects beyond the direct friend group and how the same person can have pro/anti-criminogenic effects on different people.
	4. The effect of peer influence is dependent on individual characteristics as well. It is interactional.
	5. The rational choice literature has shown how people's perceptions of the risks and rewards of crime change in group settings.

### Future work

* #causal_inference_skeptical Authors argue peer effects seem to reasonably cause individual offending. Unlikely we will ever be able to run a true experiment, though. Triangulation of research methods all point to the same conclusion. Selection and socialization processes are both in play, and it human beings are not subject to the same deterministic laws of causality as in the natural sciences.
* Focus more on identifying the mechanisms.
	* Better tests of Sutherland's underlying theory -> interaction with delinquents will structure one's belief on the acceptability of crime which will then predict future involvement in crime. #theory_challenge If you do not find that interactions with delinquents cause one to view crime as more acceptable (which will often be true), how can this refute differential association? Can it ever really be falsified?
	* Use more longitudinal data and space-time budgets and hour-by-hour recollections. Journals and diaries. Those sorts of things.
* Learn from other disciplines and how they view group decision-making processes. How do peers actually influence us? Does the role of peers change over time?
* Qualitative work.
* Study selection more carefully. How do we choose friends? It should not be something we try to control for in our study designs.
