## Abstract

In studies of race disparities in policing, scholars generally employ quantitative methodologies with the goal of determining whether race disparities exist or, in fewer instances, of ruling out correlates. Yet, lacking from theoretical and empirical efforts is an elucidation of how and why on-the-ground policing produces race disparities that are justified in legal, race-neutral terms. To address this knowledge gap, I analyze officers’ self-reported accounts of their enforcement activities, justifications, and decision-making in a representative sample of 300 official reports of drug arrests made in St. Louis from 2009 to 2013. These accounts are analyzed across neighborhood racial contexts and arrestee race, revealing important differences that help illuminate the race disparity problem. Unlike drug arrests in White neighborhoods or of White citizens that primarily stem from reactive policing, drug arrests in Black and racially mixed neighborhoods and of Black citizens result from officers’ greater use of discretionary stops based on neighborhood conditions, suspicion of ambiguous demeanor, or minor infractions. During such stops, officers’ discovery of drug possession often results from discretionary Terry frisks or searches incident to arrests for outstanding bench warrants. These findings fill important theoretical and empirical gaps and have implications for reforms toward racially just policing.

## Highlighted Notes

This connects to [[sampsonSeeingDisorderNeighborhood2004]] and how people differentially view disorder in communities.

### Overview of results.

Previous research has not helped to clarify why on-the-ground policing produces race disparities which are legally justified in race-neutral terms. Arrests in Black neighborhoods more often result from discretionary stops (unlike in White neighborhoods where it's reactive policing).

There are racial differences in violent offending, but there does not appear to be racial differences in drug usage.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E5KFTIJR?page=425&annotation=C2HHCN99) “Although evidence indicates that race disparities in arrests for violent index crimes are primarily attributable to race differences in violent offending (Sampson & Lauritsen, 1997), this is hardly true for the more prevalent nonviolent crime arrests, such as for drug charges. Race disparities in drug arrests are long-standing, large, and unwarranted. Black Americans have been overrepresented among those punished for drug crimes for more than four decades, even prior to the 'war on drugs' of the late 1980s (Human Rights Watch, 2009; Mitchell, 2009). Contemporary data show that the Black–White drug arrest disparity ratio is 2.3 to 1.0 at the national level (877 and 377, respectively, per 100,000 residents) and 5.0 to 1.0 at the state level, and there is no state where the White drug arrest rate exceeds the Black drug arrest rate (Mitchell & Lynch, 2011, pp. 144–145). Stark race disparities in punishment for drug crimes are especially unjust given that they contrast the racial composition of drug offenders. Numerous data sources generally show that Blacks and Whites engage in drugs at similar rates except in some cases... ” ([Gaston, 2019, p. 425](zotero://select/library/items/A87KGVHW)) 

[[Minority threat hypothesis]]. Police enforce the racialized social order.

This race-neutral defense, however, contradicts and downplays mounting empirical and historical evidence of racially discriminatory policing and the racialized social conditions to which police respond.” ([Gaston, 2019, p. 426](zotero://select/library/items/A87KGVHW))

### Background

Higher order processes can structure the relationship between police and disadvantage communities while being on its face racially neutral. See the crack and cocaine example.

The Supreme Court allows officers to treat the same action performed in a high-crime vs. a low-crime area to be treated differently by the police as a reason for a stop. Racial incongruity, out-of-place policing: Stopping people because they don't belong. Reifies segregation.

Wardlow (2000) allows the characteristics commonly found in disadvantaged, predominantly Black or Hispanic/Latinx neighborhoods, such as high violent crime rates, to form in part the legal basis to stop, question, and search law-abiding minority residents, reducing individualized factors required to conduct stops... ” ([Gaston, 2019, p. 428](zotero://select/library/items/A87KGVHW)) 
  
Race drives policing net of objective factors of crime and disorder and calls for service.

Their investigation further revealed that the legal rationale officers provided for stops failed to meet federal and state legal standards, suggesting that marijuana stops were pretextual in nature.” ([Gaston, 2019, p. 429](zotero://select/library/items/A87KGVHW))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E5KFTIJR?page=429&annotation=UKSC3YHH)“In summary, unwarranted, persistent race disparities in drug arrests are best understood as part of a broader, long-standing system of racialized social control used to maintain the U.S. racial hierarchy.” ([Gaston, 2019, p. 429](zotero://select/library/items/A87KGVHW))

### Research Questions

How does neighborhood/race matter? And why does it matter?

1) How does contact initiate between officers and arrestees?
2) What series of actions leads to a drug arrest?
3) What factors drives police decision making and suspicion?
4) Justifications used for actions on the part of the police?
5) Decision making and enforcement practices across neighborhood context.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E5KFTIJR?page=429&annotation=4JDVK53P) “... how and why neighborhood contextual factors and suspects’ race shape rank-and-file officers’ self-reported enforcement activities,” ([Gaston, 2019, p. 429](zotero://select/library/items/A87KGVHW)) 

How can this happen *legally* despite legal protections and the advancements we've made?

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E5KFTIJR?page=430&annotation=6R5VAMDU) “This empirical focus has the important potential of revealing how racially discriminatory policing prevails amid a host of legal protections (i.e., 4th and 14th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, federal and state civil right laws, and case laws) and in a so-called 'postracial society.'”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E5KFTIJR?page=433&annotation=CRXARTW5) “Arrest reports serve as the basis for prosecution and sentencing, inform court actors’ (e.g., prosecutors, judges, and jurors) decision making, and remain part of defendants’ criminal records and files. In other words, even if police reports inaccurately portray arrest circumstances, they fundamentally shape case outcomes and, ultimately, the fate of persons processed through the criminal justice system.” ([Gaston, 2019, p. 433](zotero://select/library/items/A87KGVHW)) Contribute to [[cumulative disadvantage]] -> [[kurlychekCumulativeDisadvantageAmerican2019]].

How do we reproduce racial disparity despite it being illegal?

### Results

Proactive vs. reactive policing depending on the racial composition of the neighborhood. White arrestees in Black neighborhoods are also predominantly arrested from proactive policing.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E5KFTIJR?page=435&annotation=LWDK6PXJ) “The officers described using mostly proactive strategies to initiate drug arrests in predominantly Black and racially mixed neighborhoods and of Black citizens. These proactive strategies included pedestrian stops, vehicle stops, and officer surveillance, all involving highly discretionary, officer-initiated activities. In contrast, drug arrests in predominantly White neighborhoods and of White citizens were less proactive and discretionary, stemming primarily from reactive strategies involving officer responses to citizen reports.” ([Gaston, 2019, p. 435](zotero://select/library/items/A87KGVHW))

I guess you see the lowest rates of proactive policing for Blacks in White neighborhoods. Still pretty high though.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E5KFTIJR?page=436&annotation=HPQWN8RW) “Officers often justified stopping or surveilling Black citizens in Black and racially mixed areas based on neighborhood conditions such as high levels of crime, social ills, or seeing persons near perceived criminogenic structures (e.g., alleys or vacant dwellings), a theme less pronounced for Blacks in White neighborhoods and not specific to White arrestees in either context. Officers expressed the greatest suspicion in Black neighborhoods likely because of the higher rates of crime and disadvantage in such communities... ” ([Gaston, 2019, p. 436](zotero://select/library/items/A87KGVHW)) 

What they observed didn't really matter. It was all about the neighborhood.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E5KFTIJR?page=437&annotation=IZDI53SB) “... officers wielded this justification to conduct proactive investigations, irrespective of whether they observed subjects engaged in suspicious or prohibited behaviors.” ([Gaston, 2019, p. 437](zotero://select/library/items/A87KGVHW)) 

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E5KFTIJR?page=438&annotation=U8H73FDG)“The narratives sometimes revealed that officers mistook Blacks’ benign actions as suspicious.” ([Gaston, 2019, p. 438](zotero://select/library/items/A87KGVHW))

Bench warrants -> more policing activity -> Black people further implicated within the system. See [[cumulative disadvantage]] and [[kurlychekCumulativeDisadvantageAmerican2019]] as well as [[brayneBigDataSurveillance2017]] and how big data policing can deepen inequality.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E5KFTIJR?page=440&annotation=74JXCZRP) “The driver was arrested for the active warrants. During the search incident to the arrest, officers reportedly found marijuana and additionally charged him for the drug crime. In another incident, an officer observed a Black subject standing near a parked vehicle and initiated a pedestrian stop 'due to the numerous calls for burglaries and drug activity in the area,'' and a computer inquiry 'revealed an active warrant from said department'...” ([Gaston, 2019, p. 440](zotero://select/library/items/A87KGVHW))

Officers enforce their view of normal in a neighborhood which often means types of people are considered suspicious just as much as suspicious activities (which are intimately tied to suspicious person).

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E5KFTIJR?page=440&annotation=S5CGNFUD) “... 'did not recognize [the subject] from the neighborhood as opposed to observing the suspect engaged in reasonably suspicious actions.” ([Gaston, 2019, p. 440](zotero://select/library/items/A87KGVHW))

Certain policing techniques were only used in Black communities.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E5KFTIJR?page=441&annotation=4KICXFI9) “Thus, buy/bust operations were another policing strategy exclusive to Black citizens and non-White neighborhoods.”

Officers behaved completely differently in White neighborhoods as compared to Black neighborhoods.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E5KFTIJR?page=441&annotation=NTFAM7QL) “... being less proactive and stemming mainly from reactive strategies. The few specialized units in White communities were generally focused on nonviolent problems like drug activity, burglary, and prostitution, and White neighborhoods and White arrestees were immune from buy/bust operations. Outstanding bench warrants were infrequent among White arrestees. Moreover, officers made few comments about the characteristics (e.g., crime, alleys, and vacant buildings) of White communities and almost never invoked them to justify stops.” ([Gaston, 2019, p. 441](zotero://select/library/items/A87KGVHW)) 

In White neighborhoods, police officers are more likely to respond to the actions of the individual rather than relying upon neighborhood contextual factors coded for race.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E5KFTIJR?page=443&annotation=PMZLV8DT) “In other words, in White arrest incidents, citizens’ behaviors guided officer-initiated decisions rather than neighborhood characteristics or individuals’ ambiguous demeanor or appearance.” ([Gaston, 2019, p. 443](zotero://select/library/items/A87KGVHW))

### Conclusions

More proactive policing in Black neighborhoods. Justified by the fact that they are *high crime* areas.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E5KFTIJR?page=444&annotation=VU3UZKHE) “For example, officers exercised their discretionary power to conduct higher rates of stops and surveillance of Black citizens and in predominantly Black and racially mixed neighborhoods.” ([Gaston, 2019, p. 444](zotero://select/library/items/A87KGVHW))

More institutionalized racism in and accumulated disadvantage as a result of increased contact between Black citizens and the police.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E5KFTIJR?page=445&annotation=UWT5ISI7) “Moreover, Black disproportionality in outstanding bench warrants increased Blacks’ risk for drug arrest in routine police encounters.” ([Gaston, 2019, p. 445](zotero://select/library/items/A87KGVHW))

Solutions? Create better incentives? Change the culture. Easy peasy

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E5KFTIJR?page=445&annotation=DN6FYIV2) “For instance, police leaders should contemplate and address the organizational policies and culture that compel rank-and-file officers to make high-quantity, low-quality stops, particularly of Black citizens.” ([Gaston, 2019, p. 445](zotero://select/library/items/A87KGVHW)) 

Interesting policy idea. Change the legal standard.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E5KFTIJR?page=445&annotation=XEBVS24D)“... reverting to Mapp’s higher standard of probable cause in police stops might prove valuable in mitigating racially disparate policing while preserving public safety.” ([Gaston, 2019, p. 445](zotero://select/library/items/A87KGVHW))

Also we should invest in these communities. To improve structural conditions! And reduce pretexts for racialized policing.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E5KFTIJR?page=445&annotation=K8REEPEJ) “Finally, public officials also play a role in racialized policing and therefore have a responsibility in mitigating it. Local, state, and federal officials, for example, shape police organizations by allocating resources and imposing standards that can either promote or undermine racially just policing. This institutional power can be used to require and incentivize police organizations to fulfill certain requirements, such as reducing race disparities. Moreover, local and state governments should minimize their reliance on police organizations as revenue-generating entities.” ([Gaston, 2019, p. 445](zotero://select/library/items/A87KGVHW))
