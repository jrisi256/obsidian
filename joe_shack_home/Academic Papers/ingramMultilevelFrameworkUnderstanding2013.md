## Abstract

Relying on a well-established theoretical paradigm from organizational psychology, the aim of the current inquiry is to apply a multilevel approach to the study of police culture that identifies workgroups as important entities that influence officers’ occupational outlooks. More specifically, we propose that police culture be assessed in a way similar to concepts in criminology, such as collective efficacy and street culture, whereby the shared features of individuals’ environments are considered. Within this framework, we draw on survey data from five municipal police agencies to examine how strongly officers within 187 separate workgroups share culture, as well as the extent to which culture differs across these workgroups. Collectively, the findings suggest that the workgroup serves as a viable context that patterns culture in police organizations. As such, the study provides a way to move beyond conceptualizations of police culture as either a purely monolithic or an individual-level phenomenon.

## My notes

- Police culture is blamed for everything but is under-theorized and not properly articulated as to how it operates, what it is, and how homogeneous/how much can individuals resist or change it.

- Work groups (patrol officers assigned to the same squad or work schedule, on the same shift, in the same precinct) represent significant boundaries within the formal organization of policing → structure officer experience and interactions -> operate at a lower level of socialization purported by monolithic accounts of culture yet at a higher level than individual-level adaptations reported by typology research (clustering officers together into similar types). **Merges micro and macro explanations**.

- **“Officers’ interactions and exposure to common features of the street and organizational environments at the work group level serve to produce shared understandings.”** Work groups represent viable cultural contexts within a department → tasks undertaken collectively creating a degree of interdependence and shared meaning making → cultural homogeneity. Also, they represent structural boundaries (in addition to these cultural boundaries).
    
- **Question 1** → Do officers within work groups share occupational attitudes and, if so, how strongly? **Yes and pretty strongly!**
	- Measured using a [[within-group agreement index]] -> represent the degree to which ratings from individuals are interchangeable or the idea that agreement reflects the degree to which individuals provide essentially the same rating.

- **Question 2** → Are there significant cultural differences across work groups even after controlling for lower-level (individual) differences and higher-level (higher structural organizations) similarities? **Yes!** Use [[Multilevel modeling|multilevel modeling]].
	- Not every cultural dimension differed across work groups, though. Most did. Suggests some features of law enforcement culture are more widely held while other features (e.g., citizen distrust) do not vary across work groups but vary more across individuals (based on individual characteristics like amount of experience).
    
- **Data & Methodology** → Surveyed patrol officers across 5 departments in 5 different states. About 1,000 officers were surveyed.

**Selection effects or socialization effects? Open question.** How long does it take to socialize officers? #question #highlight #paper_idea
