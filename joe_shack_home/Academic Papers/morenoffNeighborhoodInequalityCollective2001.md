## Abstract

Highlighting resource inequality, social processes, and [[spatial interdependence]], this study combines structural characteristics from the 1990 census with a survey of 8,872 Chicago residents in 1995 to predict homicide variations in 1996–1998 across 343 neighborhoods. Spatial proximity to [[homicide]] is strongly related to increased homicide rates, adjusting for internal neighborhood characteristics and prior homicide. Concentrated disadvantage and low collective efficacy—defined as the linkage of social control and cohesion—also independently predict increased homicide. [[Local organizations and voluntary associations]], and friend/kinship networks appear to be important only insofar as they promote the collective efficacy of residents in achieving social control and cohesion. Spatial dynamics coupled with neighborhood inequalities in social and economic capacity are therefore consequential for explaining urban violence.

## Highlighted notes

### Main findings

* Spatial proximity to homicide was associated with higher homicide rates in the focal neighborhood.
* [[Concentrated disadvantage]] and low collective efficacy are also independently associated with higher homicide rates.
* Local organizations, voluntary associations, and friendship/kinship networks appear to be important only insofar as they promote collective efficacy (by increasing social control and social cohesion).

### Problems & Questions

* We can see how the [[browningIlluminatingDownsideSocial2009]] piece comes into play particularly with their ideas of [[Negotiated coexistence|negotiated coexistence]].
* The main theoretical problems are: **1)** Strong social ties do not translate into low crime rates. **2)** In many areas, there is a lack of strong social ties yet there is low crime.
* [[Collective efficacy]] was meant to elucidate mechanisms which facilitate social control without strong ties.
* Strong social ties: **1)** promote integration, **2)** less ties to outside the community, **3)** less informal social control as a result, and **4)** allows for organized crime to emerge.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FWBD8N32?page=519&annotation=MWUZMVEG) “The intuitive appeal of social capital notwithstanding, there are reasons to problematize the process by which strong social ties translate into low crime rates. First, in some neighborhood contexts, strong ties may impede efforts to establish social control.” ([Morenoff et al., 2001, p. 519](zotero://select/library/items/C5VZUU8R)) 
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FWBD8N32?page=520&annotation=FVM2GKYG) “A second reason that it is problematic to assume a simple connection between strong social ties and low crime rates is that in many urban communities, shared expectations for social control are maintained in the absence of thick ties among neighbors (Sampson et al., 1999).” ([Morenoff et al., 2001, p. 520](zotero://select/library/items/C5VZUU8R))
* What is the role of organizations vs. social ties?
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FWBD8N32?page=525&annotation=5NS7HDJ3) “In short, most neighborhood studies to date have focused on social ties and interaction to the exclusion of organizations (see Peterson et al., 2000). For example, Sampson et al.’s (1997) test of collective efficacy highlighted cohesion and mutual expectations among residents for control. But as noted earlier, communities can exhibit intense private ties (e.g., among friends, kin), and perhaps even shared expectations for control, yet still lack the institutional capacity to achieve social control (Hunter, 1985).” ([Morenoff et al., 2001, p. 525](zotero://select/library/items/C5VZUU8R)) 

### Spatial Interdependence

* *Spatial interdependence* so we need to use spatial models.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FWBD8N32?page=522&annotation=IMDHEA2T) “we argue that neighborhoods are interdependent and characterized by a functional relationship between what happens at one point in space and what happens elsewhere. Spatial interdependence is theoretically motivated on three grounds.” ([Morenoff et al., 2001, p. 522](zotero://select/library/items/C5VZUU8R)) 

### Methods

* Census data and administrative statistics do not contain the data we need on the collective properties of these units. So we need to use surveys.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FWBD8N32?page=523&annotation=TCWXVT7I) “a growing number of studies have thus turned to original survey-based approaches to assess neighborhood-level social ties and associations.” ([Morenoff et al., 2001, p. 523](zotero://select/library/items/C5VZUU8R))
* Measuring number of social organizations and associations.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FWBD8N32?page=527&annotation=LA4QCAB5) “Organizations is an index of the number of survey-reported organizations and programs in the neighborhood-the presence of a community newspaper, block group or tenant association, crime prevention program, alcohol/drug treatment program, mental health center, or family health service. Voluntary associations taps the “social capital” involvement of residents in (1) local religious organizations; (2) neighborhood watch programs; (3) block group, tenant associations, or community council; (4) business or civic groups; (5) ethnic or nationality clubs; and (6) local political organizations.” ([Morenoff et al., 2001, p. 527](zotero://select/library/items/C5VZUU8R))
* Measurement of concentrated disadvantage.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FWBD8N32?page=527&annotation=GSIFN9BJ) “Based on the 1990 census and our theoretical framework, we examine five neighborhood structural characteristics.” ([Morenoff et al., 2001, p. 527](zotero://select/library/items/C5VZUU8R))
	* Why do they use percent black? 
		* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FWBD8N32?page=12&annotation=XCFCDWDY) “In such a segregated context, it is problematic at best to try to separate empirically the influence of percent black from the other components of the disadvantage scale, for there are in fact no white neighborhoods that map onto the distribution of extreme disadvantage that black neighborhoods experience (Krivo and Peterson, 2000; Sampson and Wilson, 1995).” ([Morenoff et al., 2001, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/C5VZUU8R))
	* Also introduce [[index of concentration at the extremes]] to capture the protective aspects of affluence. It is the (number of affluent families - number of poor families) / total number of families. Affluent families are defined as having an income above $50,000. Affluence is not just the absence of disadvantage. A value of 0 indicates parity of poor and affluent families. A value of 1 indicates all affluent families and a value of -1 indicates all poor families.
* [[Dependent variable]] is homicide count data reported to the police.
* Three problems:
	* How to deal with rare dependent count variable? Overdispersed [[Poisson regression]].
	* How do we deal with unexplained variation between neighborhoods and the underlying latent event rates? Random effects.
	* How to deal with spatial embeddedness? Use [[spatial autocorrelation]] term.

### Spatial Analysis

* How to interpret spatial autocorrelation term? For a given neighborhood *i*, a one-unit change in *p* is the effect of a one-unit change in the average homicide rate of *i's* first-order neighbors on the homicide rate of *i*. Implicit in the idea I just wrote out is the notion of diffusion even though your data might be cross-sectional.
	* They detail in their paper how to extend this logic and create the [[spatial multiplier]] equation. The authors go on to outline of how the value of *y* for neighborhood *i* depends its values of *x* and on the spatial lag of *y* for its neighbors. Those neighbors' values for their *y* depends on their values for *x* as well as the spatial lag for their neighbors and so on and so forth. Spatial dependence is encoded as a ripple where a change in *X* at location *i* influences not only the value of *y* at location *i* but also (indirectly) all other locations.

* Interpreting the model:
	* Homicide rates in *i* depend on values of *x* in spatially proximate neighborhoods. This is the effect of measured variables *x*.
		* Since above when they extended the equation, we see how a change in *x* in one area, can affect the *y* in another area.
	* They also depend on unmeasured features associated with homicide in nearby neighborhoods which are captured by the error term. This could capture things like overlapping social networks which cut across neighborhood boundaries.
	* Also endogenous feedback effects in *y* itself.

### Results

* The collective efficacy of neighboring areas also affects you. I.e. you need to model the effect your neighbors have on you as well.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FWBD8N32?page=537&annotation=QLHKXJJM) “It is therefore clear that a neighborhood’s spatial proximity to collective efficacy conditions its homicide rate, independent of its level of collective efficacy.” ([Morenoff et al., 2001, p. 537](zotero://select/library/items/C5VZUU8R))
* Concentrated disadvantage led to higher homicide rates.
* Higher affluence led to less homicides.
* Higher population density is associated with less homicides. I feel smart for picking up on that density finding. They explain it in this very long footnote here. Density is explanatory at the city level but not really the neighborhood level. [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FWBD8N32?page=540&annotation=I6KK4FTZ)
* Higher collective efficacy led to less homicides.
* Higher prior homicide rates are associated with higher current homicide rates.
* Having neighbors with higher homicide rates/lower levels of collective efficacy leads to higher rates of murder in the focal neighborhood. [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FWBD8N32?page=544&annotation=8L5EY3BY)

* Similar effects in Black vs. White neighborhoods. [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FWBD8N32?page=546&annotation=QIPZE6WZ)
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FWBD8N32?page=547&annotation=Q4IIPPKW) “Although there is evidence of differing magnitudes of effect across black and non-black neighborhoods, the overall results for collective efficacy and spatial proximity are fairly robust, taking both homicide outcomes into account.” ([Morenoff et al., 2001, p. 547](zotero://select/library/items/C5VZUU8R))
* [[browningIlluminatingDownsideSocial2009]]. Cuts against [[systemic model]]. Social ties and institutional processes operate indirectly on homicide rates by fostering collective efficacy. Insofar as social ties and institutional processes do not foster collective efficacy (by inhibiting it because ties are too thick), then these variables will not improve a community's ability to exercise informal social control. [[browningIlluminatingDownsideSocial2009]] seems to be picking up this thread directly.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FWBD8N32?page=548&annotation=JPZAYEJ5) “The traditional perspective on social disorganization predicts that homicide “hot” spots should be found predominantly in neighborhoods that are low in both ties and efficacy. Instead, the map shows that hot spots are divided almost evenly between neighborhoods that are low in both ties and efficacy (40 out of 103) and those that are high in ties and low in efficacy (38 out of 103).” ([Morenoff et al., 2001, p. 548](zotero://select/library/items/C5VZUU8R))
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FWBD8N32?page=548&annotation=MGFB3I62) “The results show that the social ties index is significantly positively associated with collective efficacy when it is introduced in models 2-5. Moreover, the institutional variables are also important correlates of collective efficacy in Table 4, even though they did not have independent associations with homicide in Tables 1 and 2.” ([Morenoff et al., 2001, p. 548](zotero://select/library/items/C5VZUU8R)
