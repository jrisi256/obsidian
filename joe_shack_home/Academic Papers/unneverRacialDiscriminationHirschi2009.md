## Abstract

In [[hirschiCausesDelinquency1969]], Travis Hirschi attempted to falsify the [[anomie|strain theory]] claim that racial discrimination might contribute to the delinquency of African American youths. A reanalysis of the Richmond Youth Project data used in his classic study, however, reveals that perceived racial discrimination is a robust predictor of delinquent involvement. This finding suggests that Hirschi missed a historic opportunity to focus the attention of a generation of criminologists on how the unique experiences of African Americans may shape their criminality. Given the salience of perceived racial bias in the lives of many African Americans, the subsequent neglect by scholars of discrimination as a potential source of crime is a remarkable omission—so much so that it constitutes a significant and as yet untold chapter in the sociology of knowledge.

## My notes

### Introduction

* Hirschi missed an opportunity to focus on the effects racial discrimination has on delinquency in line with strain theory. Perceived racial discrimination is a robust indicator of delinquency. This remarkable omission needs fixing.
  
* Paper is also partially a look into the sociology of knowledge and how knowledge is constructed through the choices of its actors. And how this choice proved quite fateful.
  
* Hirschi’s genius was how to use the survey data in the Richmond Youth Project to adequately test the different theories (strain vs. [[Social control theory|social control]]). Additionally, Hirschi did not believe that knowledge grows through integration.
  
* Hirschi measured aspirations and expectations. Found very little cases where the adolescents had a disjuncture between aspirations and expectations (no signs of strain). Furthermore, high aspirations were associated with low deviance and low aspirations were associated with high deviance.

### Current study

* **Strategy of the research team** -> Stay as faithful as possible to Hirschi’s original analysis to show he missed it. Consistent with GST, examine if effects of perceived racial discrimination vary by strength of social bonds (attachment to schools/parents, commitment to school, involvement in school activities, belief in validity of rules as measured by respecting police and if you can get away with breaking the rules, it’s ok to break them). Use other dimensions of discrimination as well (did you attend a racially hostile school? Do you think you’d get paid less? Etc. more “objective” indicators, funny word choice).
    
### Findings

* Find African-American youth more likely to offend if they have been treated badly because of their race.
  
* Find interaction effects of weak social bonds and perceived discrimination.
  
* Using other dimensions of discrimination, they don’t find effects EXCEPT for racially hostile schools. I suppose makes sense that youth wouldn’t be affected by housing or wage discrimination.
  
* Effect of discrimination rivals and even surpasses in some cases the effects of social bonds.  
      
### What could have been?

* Why did he miss it? His narrow focus on proving social bond theory and disproving strain theory as represented by Cloward and Ohlin limited the content of his analysis.
  
* In regards to racial bias, Hirschi thought those youth who had the highest self-assessment of their abilities and those who thought racial discrimination would prevent them from achieving their potential WOULD have the highest amounts of delinquency. As predicted by strain theory. Found this not to be really true.
  
* Of course acknowledged African-American youths experienced racial bias. Argued delinquency gaps could be controlled for and social bond theory was a general theory. Need not introduce race-specific ideas to better understand delinquency.

* This omission was consequential for the development of criminology (since Hirschi is such a consequential criminologist).
  
	* Recent work by strain theorists and Agnew creating GST has led to a renewed call for researchers to examine the effects of racial discrimination and strain. Of course, Agnew doesn’t deny the effects of social bonds either.
	  
	* More recent research has lent credence to the conclusion that perceived racial discrimination is a cause and not a consequence of offending.
	  
* Sadly, until recently, criminologists ignored the criminogenic effects of racial discrimination. Why? Lack of diversity in the field, perhaps.
  
	* Even more puzzling given the voluminous amount of research into the effects of racial bias in arrest, sentencing, imprisonment, and crime policy.
	  
	* In most general theories of crime, race doesn’t play a central role. It’s a variable controlled for in analysis. Perhaps can be traced to Shaw & McKay’s work which tried to show (in a progressive way) the effects of crime are general and not race-specific.
	  
	* Most self-report data on delinquency didn’t also contain measures of perceived discrimination so hard to measure the effects on the individual level.
	  
	* Third, hardly any African-American scholars. See women entering the field and how it changed the profession. Cites long list of literature how racial discrimination is a daily factor in the lives of many African-Americans which White-Americans miss.

### Future Research

* An important factor Hirschi didn’t consider is, part of Agnew’s GST, social bonds can also generate negative motivations which can be criminogenic. So more work should be done trying to integrate GST with social bond theory.
  
* Race needs to be brought back into social bond theory explicitly. [[Legal cynicism]] avenues, African-Americans have less faith in the criminal justice system. Examine effects of racially hostile schools on African-American youth.
  
* More research needed into the complex interplay of parental attachment and racism. Racism can undermine attempts to build up parental attachment bonds. African-American parents are also saddled with having to prepare their children to deal with racial discrimination. Not all parents as equally adept at navigating this treacherous terrain.
  
* Some policy considerations: over the past quarter century, criminal justice's get tough policies and attacks on the welfare state have been racially motivated. Meant to capture white votes and may have further fanned the flames of racial animus and thus criminogenic tendencies.  Second, research should be done to understand the effects of racial discrimination on effective rehabilitation programs.
