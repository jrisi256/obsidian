## Abstract

Researchers argue that white evangelical Christians are likely to support teaching creationism in public schools. Yet, less is known about the role religion may play in shaping attitudes toward evolution and teaching creationism among blacks and Latinos, who are overrepresented in U.S. conservative Protestant traditions. This study fills a gap in the literature by examining whether religious factors (e.g., religious affiliation and Biblical literalism) relate to differences in support for teaching creationism between blacks and Latinos compared to whites and other racial groups. Using a nationally representative survey (N = 9,425), we find that although black and Latino Americans support teaching creationism more than other groups, religion plays a stronger role among blacks in shaping support for teaching creationism instead of evolution. Results add an important racial dimension to scholarly discussions on religion and science and suggest further exploration of race alongside other factors that may contribute to support for teaching creationism.

## My notes

### Research question

* Religiosity and affiliation with conservative Protestant traditions are among the strongest and most consistent predictors of evolution skepticism.
  
* Does religiosity and affiliation prediction evolution skepticism among Black and Latino Americans as well? Given that evolution operates very differently for minority groups in the USA (e.g., builds solidarity and resists racial oppression).
  
	* When it comes to the question of evolution, the authors predict that Black Americans will hold a stronger stance against teaching evolution given Black (and Latino) Christians' higher levels of religious commitment.

### Methods

* Comes from a nationally representative survey of American adults conducted by a firm online using a residential address sampling frame covering 97% of households in the USA. Households without Internet were provided a computer and Internet.
  
* After missing and non-response (about 63% of respondents responded although they mention the cumulative response rate including recruitment into the panel and profile completion is only 5.6%), the final sample is 9,425.
  
	* No evidence of bias on observable variables for those who did not answer survey fully.
	  
* Estimate [[Logistic regression]] models to estimate support for teaching [[creationism]] in schools.
	* Two questions: 1) Teach creationism instead of evolution, 2) Teach them side-by-side. Collapse 5-point  [[Likert scale]] into 1/0.
	  
* **Independent variables**: Race (White, Black, Latino, other), religious tradition based on the [[RELTRAD variable]] (dummies for conservative Protestant, other Christian, Catholic, other religion, and non-religious), religious service attendance (nine category variable), personal religiosity (4 point scale concerning how religious someone considers themself), and Biblical literalism (1/0 question on whether or not the Bible is to be taken literally).
  
* **Controls**: Income, education, gender (1/0), age, region (1/0, South), political ideology, and bilingual (Spanish).

### Findings

* Table 2 -> Descriptively, minority groups are more supportive of teaching creationism instead of evolution (but Hispanics also are more supportive of teaching them side by side), and the minority groups also tend to be more religious on most dimensions, overall.
  
* Table 3 -> Dependent variable is teaching creationism alongside evolution.
	* Race is no longer significant once controls are introduced.
	* More education is associated with less odds of supporting the teaching of creationism alongside education.
	* Political conservatism is associated with higher odds.
	* Speaking Spanish is associated with higher odds.
	* Being Catholic (contrasted with the conservative Protestant reference group) is associated with higher odds (other religious affiliations were non-significant), but being non-religious was associated with lower odds.
	* The more one attended Church, the less likely one was to support this question (same goes for Biblical literalism).
	* Increasing personal religiosity was, surprisingly, associated with higher odds.
	* **Interpretation** -> Hispanic findings explained partially by the fact that Latinos have less education and are more politically conservative. Hispanics more likely to be Catholic and less likely to be nonreligious as well. Catholic doctrine is more accepting of evolution. [[Sobel tests]] of mediation found, that despite higher levels of biblical literalism among Latinos, it did not seem to mediate support. Necessity of religious networks?
	  
* Table 4 -> Dependent variable teaching creationism instead of evolution.
	* Being part of a minority group made one more likely to support the question. Being Latino remained significant across all model specifications. Being Black lost significance once religious controls were introduced.
	* Higher income and higher levels of educational attainment were less likely.
	* Strangely being female was associated with higher odds (without religious controls).
	* Being from the South was associated with higher odds (without religious controls).
	* Age had a slight negative association.
	* Political conservatism was positively associated.
	* Compared to conservative Protestants (reference group), all other religious groups were less likely to support the question.
	* Attendance, personal religiosity, and Biblical literalism all had positive associations.
	* **Interpretations**: Black respondents have lower incomes and less education. Black respondents were also more likely to be female and be from the South. Black respondents were also more likely to identify with conservative Protestant traditions, attend Church more often, and were more likely to be Biblical literalists. Since religious variables *explain away* Black support, the authors argue religion plays a stronger role in shaping support for teaching creationism among Black Americans. Other factors play a role in shaping support for teaching creationism among Latinos.

* Other results:
	* In analyses not shown, the authors found about 50% of those who preferred to teach creationism alongside evolution were neither Biblical literalists nor hardcore creationists (endorsed only teaching creationism). The authors suggest this suggests a kind of pluralism among the American population.
	  
	* #question Well this is a strange way to frame the results. The questions almost seem mutually exclusive, but is it possible for respondents to answer both in the affirmative? The above statistic seems to frame it in such a way that respondents could respond to both affirmatively. Otherwise, it would seem silly to present that (of course those who support teaching the two alongside each other would not support only teaching one).

* Big picture conclusions:
	* Black and White Americans are not very different in their support for teaching creationism and evolution together. Latinos are more likely than Whites to support the co-teaching which is explained by their lower levels of education, higher levels of political conservatism, and higher levels of Catholic affiliation (who are more accommodating).
	  
	* There are significant differences by race when looking at if individuals believe creationism should be taught instead of evolution. Religious factors explain the difference between Black and White Americans but not for Latinos. Hard to speculate as to what those factors might be. Creationism means different things to different people?
