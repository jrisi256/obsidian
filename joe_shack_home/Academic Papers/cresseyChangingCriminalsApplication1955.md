## Abstract

Behavior, attitudes, beliefs, and values are not only the products but also the properties of groups. Consequently, attempts to change individual behavior should be directed at groups. The implications for diagnosis and treatment of criminals of the theory of differential association are consistent with this principle of changing behavior by changing the group and can be effectively utilized in correctional work.

## My notes
  
* To change individual behavior, you need to change the group the individual is a part of as consistent with the theory of [[differential association]]. “If the behavior of an individual is an intrinsic part of groups to which he belongs, attempts to change the behavior must be directed at groups.” As a result, little can be done in the clinic to modify the individual because it’s the group which needs modifying.

* Reforming criminals has largely followed the clinical paradigm where the causes are diagnosed, a prescription is made, and therapy ensues. The problem with this view of things is that criminal behavior isn’t the property of an individual. The most popular analogy is criminality is like syphilis. It is spread through group contact but the individual can be treated in isolation.
  
* Any sort of group therapy attempted now is aimed at satisfying the needs of individuals through new activities rather than attempting to change the attitudes and values of the group. “Then, if criminals are to be changed, either they must become members of anti-criminal groups, or their present pro-criminal groups relations must be changed.”

### 6 principles of rehabilitation:

1. If criminals are to be changed, they must be assimilated into groups which emphasize values conducive to law-abiding behavior and alienated from groups emphasizing values conducive to crime.
2. The group’s purpose should be geared towards reformation. 
	1. E.g. unions have a strong influence over its members’ views of management but less influence over its views of African-Americans. A group organized around recreation or welfare will have less success than one whose goal it is to change criminal behavior. Material assistance, recreational activities, employment possibilities are all not enough.
3. The more cohesive the group, the greater the members’ readiness to influence others and the more relevant the problem of conformity to group norms. There must be a genuine “we” feeling between everyone (including criminals). The reformers cannot be identified as correctional workers or parole officers.
4. Both reformers and those to be reformed must achieve status within the group through prosocial values and behaviors. So part of the reformation process is to get the criminal to assign value to being part of the group and thus to adopt its values. Closely tied to 5.
5. The most effective mechanism for exerting group pressure on members will be found in groups so organized that criminals are induced to join with non-criminals for the purpose of changing other criminals. A group in which criminal A joins with some non-criminals to change criminal B is probably going to be most effective in changing criminal A. [[Retroflexive Reformation]].
6. When an entire group needs to be changed, strong pressure for change can be achieved by convincing members of the group of the need for change. Thus the group itself becomes the source of pressure for change.
