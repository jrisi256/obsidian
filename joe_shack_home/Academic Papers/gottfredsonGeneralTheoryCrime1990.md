## Abstract

By articulating a general theory of crime and related behavior, the authors present a new and comprehensive statement of what the criminological enterprise should be about. They argue that prevalent academic criminology—whether sociological, psychological, biological, or economic—has been unable to provide believable explanations of criminal behavior.The long-discarded classical tradition in criminology was based on choice and free will, and saw crime as the natural consequence of unrestrained human tendencies to seek pleasure and to avoid pain. It concerned itself with the nature of crime and paid little attention to the criminal. The scientific, or disciplinary, tradition is based on causation and determinism, and has dominated twentieth-century criminology. It concerns itself with the nature of the criminal and pays little attention to the crime itself. Though the two traditions are considered incompatible, this book brings classical and modern criminology together by requiring that their conceptions be consistent with each other and with the results of research.The authors explore the essential nature of crime, finding that scientific and popular conceptions of crime are misleading, and they assess the truth of disciplinary claims about crime, concluding that such claims are contrary to the nature of crime and, interestingly enough, to the data produced by the disciplines themselves. They then put forward their own theory of crime, which asserts that the essential element of criminality is the absence of self-control. Persons with high self-control consider the long-term consequences of their behavior; those with low self-control do not. Such control is learned, usually early in life, and once learned, is highly resistant to change. In the remainder of the book, the authors apply their theory to the persistent problems of criminology. Why are men, adolescents, and minorities more likely than their counterparts to commit criminal acts? What is the role of the school in the causation of delinquency? To what extent could crime be reduced by providing meaningful work? Why do some societies have much lower crime rates than others? Does white-collar crime require its own theory? Is there such a thing as organized crime? In all cases, the theory forces fundamental reconsideration of the conventional wisdom of academics and criminal justice practitioners. The authors conclude by exploring the implications of the theory for the future study and control of crime.

## My notes

### What predicts crime? What is self-control?

* Lack of self-control is what predicts crime. However a lack of self-control does not then mean crime is imminent. Similarly high self-control greatly reduces the possibility of crime if not altogether eliminating it. Criminal acts provide immediate gratification, they are easy, they provide few long-term benefits, and they require little skill or planning. People with low self-control who cannot delay gratification and do not have the patience for planning will thus engage in crime to fulfill their desires. There will be no specialization in crime either. Whatever is most available at hand (may lead to some de facto specialization but only because it’s easy and at hand)
  
* Crime is not an automatic or necessary consequence of low self-control. There are many noncriminal acts analogous to crime which are also manifestations of low self-control (accidents, smoking, alcohol use). Many other life-course problems too (less likely to get married, if they do get married they’re more likely to get divorced, likely to be unemployed).

### Causes of low self-control

* The major cause of low self-control is ineffective child rearing. The people in charge of raising the child fail to effectively socialize them. In order to effectively socialize them, one must: 1) monitor the child’s behavior, 2) recognize the deviant behavior when it occurs, 3) punish such behavior. So a parent can fail on any of these three criteria, and it will lead to the child having low self-control. Often people who are ineffective at raising their children have low self-control themselves. They may be discouraging of criminal behavior (even if they themselves are criminal), but they fail to instill self-control into their children.
  
	* “...fewer than 5% of the families accounted for almost half of the criminal convictions in the entire sample… much more important for the theory of crime, and for public policy…” Some notes on research of single-parent homes, step-parents, working mothers. #quote
	  
* Also talk about schools (evidence isn’t suggestive of a strong socializing effect for those children who aren’t being socialized at home) nevertheless they’re positive about the prospects for schools to socialize the children.

### Self-control and the [[Life course theory|life-course]]

* On onset, persistence, and desistance: “... the low self-control group declines over time to exhibit low self-control. Its size, however, declines.” Presumably due to the socializing effects of society? Or due to their low self-control manifesting itself in non-criminal ways? #quote 
  
* Self-control is the only personality trait which can distinguish between criminals and non-criminals.
  
* Some meta commentary about the nature of theorizing (it should not be modest). They intend for their theory to apply to all cases, for all crimes, at all times, for all behaviors (including those not sanctioned by the state). People attempting to integrate theories do so haphazardly and incorrectly because they’re trying to square assumptions which cannot be squared.
