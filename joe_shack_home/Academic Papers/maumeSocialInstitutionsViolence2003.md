## Abstract

Messner and Rosenfeld's institutional anomie theory is grounded in the assumption that relatively higher crime rates in the United States are due to (1) the overwhelming influence of economic motives and institutions in society, and (2) the subjugation of all other social institutions to cultural economic interests (e.g., the American Dream). Our analysis is designed to extend the limited body of empirical research on this theory in several ways. First, we seek to test the utility of institutional [[anomie]] theory for predicting crime rates across aggregate units within the United States (counties). Second, we draw out the theory's emphasis on instrumental crime and suggest that measures of non-economic social, political, familial, religious, and educational institutions will be particularly relevant for explaining instrumental as opposed to expressive violence. Third, in contrast to prior research, we develop conceptual reasons to expect that these factors will primarily mediate (as opposed to moderate) the relationship between economically motivating pressures and instrumental violence. Our [[negative binomial regression]] analyses of data from the Supplementary Homicide Reports and various censuses indicate that the measures of non-economic institutions perform well in explaining both instrumental and expressive homicides, but that these measures mediate the impact of economic pressures (as measured by the [[Gini coefficient]] of family income inequality) to commit instrumental violence most strongly. Further, we find only very limited support for the more popular moderation hypothesis.

### Introduction to Institutional Anomie Theory

The nature of the American Dream-fetishism of money, success by any means necessary-is a prime example of culture setting up a structure where “at all social levels, America is organized for crime” (Messner and” ([Maume and Lee, 2003, p. 1139](zotero://select/library/items/ITZ5HPR8))
  
* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TK3T65KF?page=1139&annotation=FNMRXAYS) “Thus, providing more equitable access to legitimate opportunities in the economic domain will not only fail to reduce crime, but may in fact increase crime rates by increasing emphasis on the cultural goal of economic success (Chamlin and Cochran, 1997).” ([Maume and Lee, 2003, p. 1139](zotero://select/library/items/ITZ5HPR8))

	* All other pursuits are subjugated to economic pursuits.

### Limitations

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TK3T65KF?page=1141&annotation=GVL39PJ8) “... the authors have not attempted a comprehensive empirical assessment of their theory.” ([Maume and Lee, 2003, p. 1141](zotero://select/library/items/ITZ5HPR8))
	* It may be impossible to do so.
	  
* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TK3T65KF?page=1144&annotation=MTN666LP) “*Instrumental* homicides entail lethal violence in pursuit of some material gain. Hence, the 'violence' is only instrumental to some material goal. The typical homicide in this category would be a murder committed in the course of another felony (e.g., robbery). Expressive homicides are committed in the context of an argument.” ([Maume and Lee, 2003, p. 1144](zotero://select/library/items/ITZ5HPR8))
	* Some homicides are pursued in pursuit of material gain. Others are expressions of deep emotion.

### Data and Methods

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TK3T65KF?page=1145&annotation=S8CRYEDY) “...predict instrumental rather than expressive homicides...” ([Maume and Lee, 2003, p. 1145](zotero://select/library/items/ITZ5HPR8)) Goal.
  
* **Hypothesis 1**: The strength of non-economic institutions moderates the effects of economic institutions (i.e. there is a general effect which is lessened or increased by the strength of the non-economic institutions).
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TK3T65KF?page=1147&annotation=AXXEMMKX)
	  
* **Hypothesis 2**: Non-economic institutions mediate the effect of economic institutions on homicide. Meaning an increase in the dominance of the economy will lead to a decrease in the strength of non-economic institutions (negative relationship). A weakening of non-economic institutions will make homicide more likely (negative relationship).
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TK3T65KF?page=1147&annotation=2N334R7P) “... mediating, rather than a moderating, effect? Unlike moderation, which suggests that the simultaneous interplay of social institutions is a key determinant of serious crime, mediation suggests a causal chain with an initial path linking the economy (represented by a variable treated as fully exogenous) to non-economic institutions, and a second path associating non-economic institutions with crime.” ([Maume and Lee, 2003, p. 1147](zotero://select/library/items/ITZ5HPR8))
	  
#### Measures

* Cross-sectional data for USA counties with populations of 100,000 or greater in 1990.
* The dependent variable (homicides) comes from the Supplementary Homicide Reports. rates are calculated per number of people aged 10 to 64.
	* **Instrumental homicides** are all felony-murders and suspected felonies (e.g., robbery-murders) as well as gangland and youth killings.
	* **Expressive homicides**: Variety of circumstance codes which are used to code a homicide as an expressive homicide (e.g., lovers' triangles).
* **Independent variables**
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TK3T65KF?page=1155&annotation=JPNYNRUI) “As noted above, we use the Gini coefficient of income inequality as our indicator of the influence and structure of economic conditions on crime rates. There is some debate among criminologists regarding what the Gini coefficient actually captures (see, e.g., Bailey, 1984). Does it measure the dominance of the economy?” ([Maume and Lee, 2003, p. 1155](zotero://select/library/items/ITZ5HPR8))
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TK3T65KF?page=1155&annotation=XY2W75XZ) “To measure participation in the political sphere, we employ a measure of average voter turnout for the 1988 and 1992 presidential elections. This measure is consistent with prior research, and it is expected that greater levels of voter turnout will be associated with lower rates of instrumental homicide.” ([Maume and Lee, 2003, p. 1155](zotero://select/library/items/ITZ5HPR8))

	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TK3T65KF?page=1155&annotation=C3LCB8WD) “... the average educational expenditures per person of school age for 1987 and 1992 in the county, and the rate of adherence to civically engaged religious denominations.” ([Maume and Lee, 2003, p. 1155](zotero://select/library/items/ITZ5HPR8)
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TK3T65KF?page=1156&annotation=SACYP8SB) “... average monthly welfare payments per poor person adjusted for cost of living (as the average proportion of local incomes devoted to rent), and the proportion of poor families receiving welfare.” ([Maume and Lee, 2003, p. 1156](zotero://select/library/items/ITZ5HPR8)) Is the proportion of families receiving welfare really a measure of generosity?
	* #disagree I am skeptical as to how much these variables match the hypothesized constructs.

### Results

* Find most support for the mediation hypothesis.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TK3T65KF?page=1167&annotation=YPXQS4CR) “As expected, our data indicate that the presence of non-economic institutions has a particularly pronounced mediating effect on the link between income inequality and instrumental homicide, accounting for almost half of the direct association. However, we find only very limited support for the moderation hypothesis.” ([Maume and Lee, 2003, p. 1167](zotero://select/library/items/ITZ5HPR8))
