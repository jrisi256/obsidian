## Abstract

Most comprehensive discussions of the police acknowledge the inability of legal and bureaucratic regulations to determine officer behavior. Attention is turned instead toward the informal norms developed within the police subculture. These discussions, however, tend to overstress the chasm between the formal and informal. They also provide inadequate tools for understanding differentiation, conflict, and change within police departments. I address these shortcomings here by mobilizing a particular conceptualization of the term “normative order”—as a set of rules and practices oriented around a central value. Six such orders are crucial to policing: law, bureaucratic control, adventure/machismo, safety, competence, and morality. I illustrate the importance of each by drawing upon ethnographic observations of the Los Angeles Police Department, and explain how my conceputalization offers a comprehensive yet flexible means to understand the social world of policing.

## My notes

### Research Question
    
Typical descriptions of the police stress the inability of formal laws and regulations to adequately control police behavior (distinct and differentiated from the public). Informal customs are determinative of police action, not formal rules. Officers are **insular**, **suspicious**, **masculine**, and focused on **risk**.
    
**Problem 1**: The distinctions between formal and informal rules (legal rules and regulations vs. the ethos of the subculture) aren’t so likely to be so sharp. Formal rules likely have some effect, but officers interpret them in particular ways forming the basis for an ethos to emerge.
    
**Problem 2**: The policing subculture isn’t a monolithic, cohesive whole. One approach is the **two cultures approach** (management cops vs. street cops). The distinction between the two likely isn’t so large. It ignores commonalities. **Individual approaches** can be too rigid and not take into account group pressures and socialization.
    
**Culture** → Culture as a tool kit or collection of stories, rituals, and world views which humans employ dynamically to help them make sense of the world and new scenarios. **Problem 1**: We need more precise analytic concepts than a tool kit. **Problem 2**: This approach neglects a normative component. End values don’t shape the contours of action. Culture is important for shaping action and organizing it but not directing it towards some ultimate end. _The author thinks this goes too far_ → Meaning is made cogent because they exemplify shared values.
    
### Data and Methodology 

Ethnographic fieldwork studying the LAPD.
    
### Results

**Normative Order**: Internalized values structure individual behavior. Shared values among a social group lead to social stability. **Criticism** (no sense of agency, emphasizes consensus rather than conflict). **New definition** (a set of rules and practices centered around a primary value, can have multiple orders which might conflict). Rules aren’t just formal.

Each of the below 6 orders enables and constrains officers. Can serve as resources to justify officer action. They may at times be impossible to reconcile. Boundaries between them aren’t super strict. Officers in different units or officers in the same unit but in different ranks will define and rank their normative orders differently.
    
Efforts at reform will depend on the political struggle to redefine police work around a different balance between normative orders. It will also entail redefining some normative orders.

#### Normative Orders

- **Law**
- **Bureaucratic Control**
- **Adventure/Machismo**: Demonstrate bravery and courage. Put yourself in uncomfortable and dangerous situations.
- **Safety**
- **Competence**
- **Morality**
