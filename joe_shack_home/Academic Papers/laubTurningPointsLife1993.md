## Abstract

This article examines conceptual issues relating to continuity and change in crime over the life course. Building on past efforts, we first distinguish self-selection from a cumulative, developmental process whereby delinquent behavior attenuates adult social bonds (e.g., labor force attachment, marital cohesion). We then conceptualize various types of change and argue that social capital and turning points are crucial in understanding processes of change in the adult life course. These concepts are illustrated by examining person-based, life-history data drawn from the Gluecks' longitudinal study of 1,000 men. Although adult crime is clearly connected to childhood behavior, these qualitative data suggest that both incremental and abrupt change are structured by changes in adult social bonds. We conclude with some hypotheses and implications for future research on subjective contingencies, opportunity structures, and chance encounters as potential turning points for change, especially as they interact with race, class location, and historical context.

## My notes

### Introduction

As an individual’s bonds to society weaken or strengthen, this will determine their propensity to commit crime over their life course. Both formal and informal social control vary across the life span.

“... emphasize the role of informal social control as reflected in the structure of interpersonal bonds linking members of society to one another and to wider social institutions. Unlike formal controls that originate in purposeful efforts to control crime, informal social controls emerge as by-products of role relationships established for other purposes and are components of role reciprocities.” #quote

Emphasize reciprocal causal processes wherein dependent variables become independent variables (delinquency has the effect of weakening social bonds).

[[Life course theory|Life course]] theory focuses on ->
1. The mediating role of family and school social bonds in explaining childhood delinquency.
2. Subsequent continuity of childhood antisocial behavior into adulthood across a variety of domains (crime, unemployment, substance abuse).
3. Building block is social bonds in adulthood particularly attachment to labor force and cohesive marriage explain criminal behavior regardless of prior differences in criminal propensity. The quality/strength of these social ties are very important. Marriage alone doesn’t increase social control but close emotional ties and mutual investment do, and all else equal, should lead to a reduction in criminal behavior. Same for employment. Being employed by itself isn’t the key factor.

These constitute turning points in the life course. Despite the connection between childhood events and adulthood, turning points modify life trajectories and redirect life paths. For most individuals, this is a process-oriented change which happens incrementally.

Theory **ALSO** takes into account the causal role of prior delinquency in facilitating adult crime -> **state dependency** and **cumulative continuity**. Juvenile delinquency has the effect of systematic attenuation of social/institutional bonds (arrest and incarceration cause failure in school) which in turn make adult crime all the more likely. It kills future opportunities, cumulative disadvantage, kills future adult bonds from being formed.

“... found little direct effect of incarceration on subsequent criminality, the indirect criminogenic effects through job stability were substantively important.” Incarceration makes it too hard to get a job later in life through stigma and deskilling. #quote 

Structural component of [[labeling theory]]. May even become multi-generational. Concentrated among the lower classes who are policed more and incarcerated more. “... avoiding the snares of arrest and institutionalization provided opportunities for prosocial attachments…” Just have more opportunities to establish binding ties to conformity and conventional lines of adult activity. #quote 

### Self-selection criticism

Critics argue individual differences combine with self-selection to account for patterns of behavior across the life course. I.e. individuals with an early propensity to crime determined by family socialization and individual traits systematically sort themselves through adulthood into states consistent with their latent traits.

Sampson/Laub find this isn’t true. Certainly homophily explains mating selection, but “... involvement in the new relationship has further effects and influences on that individual… The emergence of significant social causation in tandem with homophily (i.e. self-selection) undermines theoretical individualism…” #quote 

Overemphasis on self-selection stems from the fiction of independent individuals each of whom acts to achieve goals that are independently arrived at and social systems are combinations of actions of independent actors.

Furthermore, childhood variables are pretty poor prognostic devices, too many false positives and false negatives. Change is far more possible than the literature has admitted.

### Change

Change happens when individuals invest social capital into institutional relationships. It changes relations in such a way so as to facilitate action that wouldn’t have been possible otherwise without the investment.

The lack of social capital is one of the primary features of weak social bonds. What characteristics of social relations make social capital become available? One important factor is closure or interconnectedness. It isn’t simply introducing a new relationship, but the quality and commitment into that relationship. Creates systems of obligation and restraint which impose costs for criminal behavior.

Change comes, then, from increasing embeddedness as much as from internal changes.

The investments are made into each other (ideally). It becomes reciprocal.

### Future Research

Why do some individuals change and others do not? What predicts strong marital attachment in adulthood? How do troubled youths achieve job stability and a strong commitment to work as adults?

“One is simply that there is an element of luck, randomness, or change operating throughout the course of life.” #quote 

“Confluence of objective and subjective contingencies.” Not all men viewed marriage/full-time work as an opportunity to change their life-course trajectory. #quote

Macro-level structural forces play a big role in determining things like the health of the labor market.

Race and place.

Historical/political contexts (G.I. Bill offered many the opportunity to change their life-course). Now globalization has hurt those prospects.
