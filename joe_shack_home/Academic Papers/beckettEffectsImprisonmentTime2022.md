## Abstract

Imprisonment has deleterious effects on prisoners' mental, physical, social, and economic well-being. These harms are long lasting and affect prisoners' partners and children. In the United States and elsewhere, imprisonment disproportionately inflicts these harms on people of color and people living in poverty. Although imprisonment is regarded as a reasonable and effective means of protecting the public, it is not, when compared with nonconfinement alternatives, an effective way to achieve public safety. Two broad sets of policy reforms would be better: retroactive and prospective sentencing reforms that reduce reliance on confinement for all types of offenses, including violent crimes, and broad initiatives that reduce reliance on prison and jails while also investing in housing, education, treatment, health, and communities. Researchers and policy analysts need to engage in problem-solving research that examines not only incarceration's effects but alternative ongoing efforts to achieve public safety and justice.
## Section 1: The effects of imprisonment

A quick note on the potentially positive effects of incarceration:
* E.g., for some imprisoned women, it can provide a temporary refuge from abuse, extreme, poverty and marginalization.
* It can provide an interruption into lethal patterns of drug use.
* A relatively safe place to sleep, three meals a day, and regular access to healthcare.
* Usually these findings are concentrated in prisons outside of the USA. The punitive mission of prisons in the USA usually interfere with other goals of rehabilitation and offering a place to reflect.
* Authors argue this ultimately reveals the deep deprivation, marginalization, and structural violence people in poverty experience inside and outside of prison.
* #quote "It is true that establishing a causal connection between imprisonment and adverse outcomes in individual studies is challenging because of selection bias, limited longitudinal data, variation in the operationalization of key variables, and limited measures of health and other metrics ([[travisGrowthIncarcerationUnited2014]], [[massogliaIncarcerationHealth2015]], [[massogliaLinkagesIncarcerationHealth2019]])."

US imprisonment worsens the mental and physical health of the imprisoned in the short term and the long term. For some groups (particularly Black men), particularly disadvantageous conditions outside of prison mean that incarceration can improve access to health care and reduce mortality in the short term, but incarceration exacerbates these problems in the long run.

### Health
#### Psychological Harms

* Psychological harms --> See [[Gresham Sykes and five pains of imprisonment]]. Although the article only lists 4.
	* Deprivation of liberty (e.g., restricted movement and social isolation).
	* Deprivation of goods and services.
	* Diminished autonomy (e.g., compulsion to comply with arbitrary rules).
	* Physical vulnerability and insecurity.
* Recent research has found imprisonment has a variety of negative effects on mental health and well-being both during and after incarceration. Prisons are fraught with danger, dehumanization, and deprivation. Prisoners must adapt to prisons to survive making it hard for them to function outside of prison.
* Different research focuses on how different aspects of incarceration is harmful e.g., see above examples.

#### Access to Healthcare

* People who experience imprisonment tend to have poor health and limited access to healthcare before incarceration (as well as during and after). Poor health of of prisoners is attributable to overlapping issues of substance use, infectious disease, mental illness, homelessness, limited access to healthcare, and general poverty.
	* Healthcare in prisons is a Constitutional right. Prisons can become areas of last resort for access to medical care e.g., screening for HIV, housing the elderly.
	* Availability and quality of care varies widely.
	* Recently released prisoners tend to have a hard time accessing healthcare once they're released from prison.

#### Mortality

* Hard to determine if incarceration is actually worsening already poor health.
	* Theoretically, it could.
		* Acute and chronic stress and increased risk of infectious disease transmission while incarcerated.
		* Social and economic marginalization post-release.
	* Mortality rates for incarcerated Black men are lower than for non-incarcerated Black men. Incarceration eliminates main causes of death for Black men (e.g., gun violence, transportation accidents) and increases access to healthcare.
		* Differences in mortality disappear after release and in fact spike immediately right after being released (overdoses and suicide).
	* For other groups, the differences in mortality are in the anticipated direction.

#### Public health

* Associations have been found between higher rates of incarceration and worse public health. Through which mechanisms?
	* Limited access to healthcare for the formerly incarcerated as well as their families.
	* Incarceration can increase the spread of infectious diseases particularly sexually-transmitted diseases.

### Employment, Earnings, and Wealth

#### Prior to incarceration

* Imprisonment predominantly occurs among individuals with lower levels of education, spotty employment histories, and comparatively low incomes.

#### During incarceration

* As stated earlier, most people who are imprisoned were unemployed prior to their incarceration.
* Many prisoners work while imprisoned, but the income earned is particularly low.
* Prisoners are often straddled with many fees and fines imposed on them forcing them to pay for many aspects of their incarceration.

#### After incarceration

* Formerly incarcerated individuals continue to experience lower levels of employment and lower wages following their release. Harms lifetime earnings, and it appears that more time spent behind bars is associated with worse outcomes.
* #question Questions about causality remain. Most quantitative studies are unable to generate a plausible counter-factual group (i.e., similarly situated individuals who are the same in all the relevant ways except for the fact they have not bee incarcerated). How might we go about establishing causality?
	* **Stigma**. Formerly incarcerated individuals have a harder time finding work (because of their formerly incarcerated status).
	* **Internalized stigma**. Formerly incarcerated individuals have widespread disengagement with the labor market. Is it all due to formal stigma? Some research points to internal stigma.
	* **Hidden sentencing**: Many formerly incarcerated individuals lose many of their former rights upon returning to society (e.g., barred from certain jobs or obtaining certain certifications).
	* **Challenges associated with reintegration** --> Complying with bureaucratic criminal justice system procedures, navigating new technology, crowds, and other aspects of daily life, fears of surveillance and [[Legal cynicism|legal cynicism]] cause disengagement with other formal institutions (e.g., education, financial, medical) [[system avoidance]].
* **Local neighborhood conditions** --> Formerly incarcerated individuals tend to return to neighborhoods with poor employment outcomes. Local economic conditions influence the employment trajectories of the formerly incarcerated.
* **Racialized social networks** --> Formerly White incarcerated individuals tend to do better in terms of reintegrating with the labor force, and researchers believe this may have to do with social networks. #question I will note that there does not seem to be much research on this issue.
### Familial relationships

#### Marriage and partnerships

* Incarceration increases the likelihood that a preexisting romantic relationship will end.
	* Studies which found that people who served their sentence at home under electronic monitoring had a 13.3 percentage point lower risk of relationship dissolution. #quote 
	* The physical separation seems to be the main reason why the relationship ends although stress and strain play a role, too.
* How does incarceration affect the likelihood of future relationships forming? The findings generally find that it causes a decrease in the likelihood of **marriage** #highlight (hard to study relationships more generally).
* Aggregate studies on the effect of incarceration on marriage rates have yet to reach a consensus on how incarceration affects marriage rates, generally.

#### Relationship with children

* Sometimes incarceration can cause children to rebuild bonds (particularly with the non-incarcerated family members), but most research finds that it fractures the relationship between parent and child.
	* Less parent-child engagement (stemming mostly from changes in the father and mother's relationship as fathers who were not living with their child prior to incarceration experienced relatively little change in engagement), less shared responsibility in terms of parenting, less financial contributions.
	* #highlight Although this paper does not go into details, they state that less engagement leads to worse outcomes for children.
