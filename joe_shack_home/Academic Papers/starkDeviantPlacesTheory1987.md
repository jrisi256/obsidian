## Abstract

It is well known that high rates of [[crime]] and deviance can persist in specific neighborhoods despite repeated, complete turnovers in the composition of their populations. That this occurs suggests that more than “kinds of people” explanations are needed to account for the ecological concentration of deviance—that we also need to develop “kinds of places” explanations. This essay attempts to codify more than a century of ecological research on crime and deviance into an integrated set of 30 propositions and offers these as a first approximation of a theory of deviant places.

## My notes

* High rates of crime and deviance can persist in specific neighborhoods despite complete turnovers in the composition of the populations. Suggests that more than *kinds of people* explanations are needed and instead we need *kinds of places* explanations.

* **Five factors leading to high deviancy in cities**:
	1. **Density**. The greater the density, the more association between those most and least disposed to deviance. E.g. in a low-density area (like a suburb), can take considerable effort to meet-up and thus much easier to control whom you interact with. In high-density areas, peer groups tend to be inclusive and maximum peer pressure to deviate will emerge.
	2. **Poverty**. To the extent that neighborhoods are dense and poor, homes will be crowded.
	3. **Mixed use**. More crowded homes will result in greater tendency for people to congregate outside the home. In mixed-use neighborhoods, leads to increases in temptations and opportunity to deviate. Poorer, denser neighborhoods tend to be mixed-use neighborhoods. Landlords welcome it because it raises rents. Landlords allow housing to crumble because it isn’t profitable to reinvest in residential housing.
	4. **Transience**. Poor, dense mixed-use neighborhoods have high rates of transience. As transience rates increase, it makes it harder for families to form cohesive bonds. More generally, transience makes it harder for people to settle down and lay down roots. No attachment to the area you live. As a result, voluntary membership organizations suffer which hurts a community’s opportunity to self-fix its deviance problems. They will also have less ability to influence how external forces act upon them (police, zoning boards). Posits that organizational membership is a linking mechanism between transience and deviancy. Can be controlled to break the link between the two.
	5. **Dilapidation**.  Dense, poor, mixed-use, transient neighborhoods will be dilapidated. This is a social stigma for residents.

* **Impacts of these five factors on people**:
	1. **Moral cynicism**. The greater the density, the higher the level of moral cynicism. Not as easy to *keep up appearances*. Thin walls, tightly packed, can’t hide as much of our baggage. As such, people’s respect for conventional moral standards will be reduced since we now know we’re all hypocrites.
	2. **Increased opportunities for crime**.
	3. **Increased motivation to deviate**.
	4. **Diminished social control**. Overcrowded homes lead to less supervision of children. Additionally crowded homes lead to higher levels of within-family conflict thus weakening attachments and stakes in conformity. Reduced levels of child supervision lead to poor school achievement and consequent reduction in stakes in conformity.

* **People’s responses will then further amplify the volume of deviance by**:
	1. **Attracting more crime-prone people and more criminal activities to the neighborhood**. More lenient law enforcement will draw people to the neighborhood based on their involvement in crime and deviance. This causes the visibility of such crimes to increase and the opportunity to engage them increases as well. Also temptations increase as you're assaulted by these opportunities on a daily basis. Also the high visibility convinces people these activities must be safe to do.
	2. **Driving out the least deviant**. Living in an area with a high crime rate is a social stigma for residents. Living in a stigmatized neighborhood causes a reduction in an individual’s stake in conformity. This causes less crime-prone individuals to leave the area. Additionally less crime-prone individuals will avoid moving to the neighborhood.
	3. **Further reducing social control**. Stigmatized neighborhoods suffer from more lenient law enforcement. Claims the police tend to be reactive and since people in stigmatized neighborhoods complain less often and are less willing to testify. Police soon lose interest in futile efforts to solve the crimes. Police may even have incentives to *contain* crime to one area and view the neighborhood as deserving of it since the people who live in it are of low repute. This further contributes to moral cynicism as people see others committing crimes with relative impunity.
