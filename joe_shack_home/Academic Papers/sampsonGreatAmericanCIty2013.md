## My notes

### Chapter 2 (pages 31 - 49)

* [[Social disorganization]] (SD) was challenged by [[William F. Whyte]] who in 1943 argued there was an internal organization with *socially disorganized*. neighborhoods. Gangs, illegal markets, dense and robust kin/friendship [[networks]]. Argued the social organization of these [[neighborhoods]] failed to mesh with the larger structure of society around it.
* Another important criticism was made around 1970. Neighborhoods are deeply shaped by extra-local processes, namely [[economic]] and [[political]] structures. Hard to overemphasize the “naturalness” with which [[Park and Burgess]] thought of in “natural areas” that seemingly just popped out of nature almost by some sort of social law due to [[free market]] competition and competing desires of businesses and residents for affordable land and decent [[housing]].
* Marxists like [[David Harvey]] argued SD ignored the logic of [[capital]] accumulation, collusion of [[government]] and [[business]], and structural/institutional [[racism]]. Think of [[zoning laws]], [[disinvestment]], [[highway]] building, [[tax breaks]], [[public housing]] fights, [[segregation]], [[redlining]] (public and private). Neighborhoods (just live individuals) must be seen as mediating extra-local forces.
* Place-based analysis tries to account for these critiques: [[William Julius Wilson]] ([[concentrated poverty]]). Relationships between race and individual outcomes are systematically confounded with important differences in community contexts. Others too, pick on these threads.
* Keep in mind the downsides of community organizing ([[NIMBY]]s). How do we avoid this? They have high forms of [[Collective efficacy]] but in service of not so good things.
* Some issues in the field today. What [[emergent]] properties are responsible for the problems we see in neighborhoods with high amounts of concentrated poverty? What is it about concentrated poverty that’s so bad?
* #causal_inference_skeptical 
* Sampson on [[experiments]] and [[Moving to Opportunity]], “... does not answer important theoretical questions that I ask, including how individuals select themselves into neighborhoods and how individual perceptions (and in turn selection itself) are influenced by neighborhood characteristics. MTO also randomized individuals rather than neighborhoods… the offer of a voucher does not tell us the social mechanisms that account for why neighborhoods have effects on individuals, if in fact they do. Causal explanation requires theory that organizes knowledge about unobserved mechanisms that bring about the effect, a challenge that demands a base of rigorous observational evidence.” #quote 
* Causal questions aren’t the only ones, and the experimental method alone is ill-equipped for the study of neighborhood-level phenomena and macro-level social processes that unfold over long periods of time. Not to say individual choice or causal inference are unimportant.

### Chapter 7 (pages 149 - 178)

* Sampson wants to preserve some part of SD, “Community level variations in [[Social control theory|social control theory]] contribute to varying crime rates.” Recognize what’s useful about it and discard the rest. #quote 
* So Sampson proposes [[Collective efficacy]] -> “Social cohesion” and “shared expectations for control”. Accepts the idea of social disorganization theory that social control is a collective challenge not attributable to the characteristics of individuals alone. Relaxes the assumption, though, for strong neighborhood ties. Institutional mechanisms may be sufficient, and working trust and social interaction are needed on some level but not necessarily most important.
* “Activation of latent resources to achieve an intended effect.” #quote 
* The logic of collective efficacy is not disproven by critics. Think of coming together as a community to solve a problem. On some level, you have a basic trust and shared sense of values. But you aren’t going to necessarily be everyone’s friend.
* [[Ecometrics]] -> We have to take seriously the measurement of community-level properties. Building on [[psychometric]] research and [[ecology]].
* Collective efficacy predicts the event (or location) rate of violence in a neighborhood. It does not necessarily predict the offending propensity of neighborhood youths who live in that neighborhood (and who may then go on to commit crimes in other neighborhoods). They found low collective efficacy neighborhoods attracted more crime. Individual delinquency is deterred by by the collective efficacy of neighborhoods where adolescents spend their time (tightly linked to how much unstructured socializing time you have with peers).
* Sampson thinks collective efficacy also goes way beyond street crime and can help explain a variety of other factors ([[asthma]], [[birth weight]], etc.).

* Individuals self-select into the community + the outside social, political, and economic forces come to bear on the internal mechanisms within a community that drive or inhibit collective efficacy which is thus in turn linked to being able to control crime (page 161).
* ![[sampsonGreatAmericanCity2013_fig7-6.png]] #figure
* Communities which saw a decrease in collective efficacy and a decrease in poverty (solid black line, 2nd from the bottom) did much better than communities which saw an increase in collective efficacy but also an increase in poverty (solid dashed line, 2nd from the top). <mark>Why is there so much focus on collective efficacy when alleviating poverty seems like it should be the main concern? It would allow individuals to self-organize and achieve collective efficacy?</mark> #highlight 
* Interesting note in the conclusion over how to account for communities with high levels of collective efficacy despite large amounts of structural disadvantages as well as how do legacies of communities get passed on despite high rates of mobility.

  
### Chapter 17 (pages 414 - 426)

* We Americans love free choice and individualized solutions. For place-based problems, this is encapsulated by [[vouchers]]. You can move away from the *bad* places. And then as more people leave, we can demolish the [[ghetto]].
* What about, instead, we renew the communities? Rather than arguing against vouchers, let’s make neighborhoods units of holistic policy intervention. And make plans for improving the social infrastructure. [[Community policing]] where individuals and police meet at neutral areas to discuss where the problems are in the community. This allows for informal social control and citizen input to be in alignment with official forms of justice, in theory.
* Community reentry programs for ex-prisoners. But also stopping people from going to jail/prison. “The key to success is smarter and more efficient policing yoked to a community-based focus that stresses good police-citizen relationships.” #quote 
* Sampson stresses we need *non-crime*” policies to go along with our *crime* policies.
* Intervening at the community is more effective and cost-efficient than targeting individuals (for whom it’s often impossible to predict things). Community social structures, on the other hand, are highly patterned.
* Goes back to his critique of experiments -> We don’t know if things can scale or be transported (e.g. [[Harlem Children’s Zone]]) because we still don’t know the mechanisms which make the program successful. Sampson suspects they cannot be moved. Once an intervention takes hold, both formal and informal rules changes and interconnected actions accumulate which create new structures. Look to the success of population-level health policy. We can more rigorously study these processes, intervene, and evaluate holistically.
* Is life a construction of independent self-maximizing individuals? Or is life rooted in collective processes (the *we*) that come together in neighborhoods and communities steeped in shared understanding?
