## Abstract

The effects of gang membership on individual social, behavior, cognitive, and health outcomes are well documented. Yet, research consistently has shown that gang membership and the boundaries of gangs are often fluid and amorphous. The current study examines how social proximity to a gang member in one's co-offending network influences the probability of being a gunshot victim. We re-create and analyze the social network of all individuals who were arrested, summonsed for a quality-of-life violation, and subjected to noncustodial police contacts in Newark, New Jersey, during a 1-year time period (N = 10,531). A descriptive network analysis finds an extreme concentration of fatal and nonfatal gunshot injuries within a small social network: Nearly one third of all shootings in Newark occur in a network that contains less than 4 percent of the city's total population. Furthermore, a series of logistic regression models finds that being directly or indirectly linked to a gang member in one's co-offending network has a significant effect on one's probability of being a gunshot victim. Implications of these findings for the study of gangs, gun violence, and a public health approach to violence are discussed.

## My notes

### What is the research question?

* Can the risks of gang membership extend beyond being a part of the gang to affect others who are indirectly (or directly) tied to the gang but are not actually part of the gang?
* How does social proximity to a gang member relate to the probability of being a gunshot victim?

### Why is it important?

* Gang membership is a fluid concept, and we need to treat it that way more often.
* It is important to consider how gangs and gang members are part of the larger social fabric of their community, and how it can affect the larger community as a result.

### How do you propose to answer your question?

* Examine the co-offending networks among all individuals who were arrested, summoned, and subjected to noncustodial police contacts in [[Newark, NJ]] for 1 year. #Newark 
* People are listed as co-offenders if they are both listed on the same report, arrest, or summons. Of course, this is an imperfect measure. You do not get the true social network.
* Social distance to a gang member is measured the minimum [[geodesic distance]] between the two. Basically, the shortest path in the graph between two individuals. Standardized the value. Ranges between 0 (no connection to a gang member) to 1 (immediately connected to a gang member).
* Identify individuals as being part of a gang through the Newark Police Department's gang database.s

### What do you find?

* There is an extreme concentration of fatal and nonfatal gunshot injuries. Nearly one-third of all shootings occur in a network that contain less than 4% of the city's total population. [[social network analysis]]. #social_network_analysis
* [[Logistic regression]] models indicate that the closer the one is to a gang member, the more likely you'll be a gunshot victim.
* Also used [[Multilevel modeling|multilevel modeling]] where level 2 units were the network component or the subgraph of the network you were a part of. Virtually no change in results. Allowed for varying intercepts and slopes.

### Limitations

* Cannot address selection. Perhaps riskier individuals self-select into these relationships and so the relationship is confounded so to speak. They do control for an individual's level of criminal involvement during the observation period, though.
