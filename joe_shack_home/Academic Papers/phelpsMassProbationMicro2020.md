## Abstract

Between 1980 and 2007, probation rates in the United States skyrocketed alongside imprisonment rates; since 2007, both forms of criminal justice control have declined in use. Although a large literature in criminology and related fields has explored the causes and consequences of mass incarceration, very little research has explored the parallel rise of mass probation. This review takes stock of our knowledge of probation in the United States. In the first section, I trace the expansion of probation historically, across states, and for specific demographic groups. I then summarize the characteristics of adults on probation today and what we know about probation revocation. Lastly, I review the nascent literature on the causal effects of probation for individuals, families, neighborhoods, and society. I end by discussing a plan for research and the growing movement to blunt the harms of mass supervision.

### Background

While research is focused on the effects of incarceration, it is still a relatively uncommon phenomenon. Police contact and probation are much more common.

While probation is seen as a less severe alternative to incarceration, it also serves as a net widener which increases the punishment for lower-level offenses where there never was the possibility of incarceration. While it is seen as a slap on the wrist, it introduces a list of demands and restrictions that can be quite onerous. Individuals on probation also face a steep risk of being incarcerated.

* Probation is a delayed path to incarceration, some argue. Probation to prison pathway lined with technical violations. Probation is particularly dire for disadvantaged probationers who do not have the resources to comply with the terms of their probation.

* Probation officers have enormous discretion to file revocation motions. The decision to apply sanctions or not is usually up to the judge who also have enormous discretion. There are fewer procedural protections and lower burdens of proof than normal.

Substantial variation from state to state in terms of probation rates.

While both probation and incarceration grew nationally, this masks substantial state-level variation in these dual trends.

### Effects of Probation

#### Micro-level

* Ethnographic research on the micro-level consequences of probation focus on the material and psychological burdens faced by probationers attempting to reintegrate back into their old lives while maintaining compliance with all the new rules they must follow. Attempting to spend time with family, employment, treatment programs, reporting obligations, financial obligations, and dealing with the threat of revocation.

* Proponents argue that probation is an alternative to incarceration that allows one to serve out their sentence in their community. It helps improve employment outcomes, increases access to treatment, and reduces rates of criminal behaviors. It allows punishment to take place in a context that can better promote reintegration and rehabilitation.
	* Is this true or does it merely add stress to already marginalized peoples' lives?
	  
* Both can be true.

* Estimating the counterfactual is hard. What is an appropriate control group for receiving community supervision? Nothing? Some alternative intermediate sanction? Incarceration?
	* Deal with heterogeneity -> types of persons receiving probation vs. variation in probation treatments.
	* Some estimates of the causal impact of incarceration show no differences vs. probation, or less risk of incarceration in the future because parole is so much more punitive than probation.
	* we know nothing about the effects of probation on the margins vs. no supervision or some alternative intermediate sanction altogether.

#### Meso-level

Is the expansion of community supervision a progressive development or a dystopian dispersal of discipline?

* It involved people who otherwise would not have been punished, exposed probationers to state scrutiny, expanded the scope of the criminal justice system, and it was greatly involved in the disciplining of citizens even outside of the scope of formal laws and rules.
  
* We know very little about how probation has changed family life, neighborhood dynamics, and society more broadly. 

#### Marco-level

A true less-punitive alternative to incarceration or simply a net widener which ultimately leads to higher rates of imprisonment.

Relationship of probation to crime is unexplored.

How does probation reinforce racial hierarchy?
