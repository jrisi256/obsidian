## Notes

### Data

* Use the Gluecks' research data which longitudinally followed a group of socioeconomically disadvantaged white men who had a moderate to large amount of involvement in crime.
	* Massachusetts sample of boys ages 10 - 17 who had just been released from juvenile delinquency programs in during the late 1930's and early 1940's. Sampled 500 white males.
	* Also sampled 500 non-delinquents from Boston public schools.
	* Pretty strong matching strategy for delinquents to non-delinquents (age, race, neighborhood, measured intelligence). The neighborhood matching was, in particular, pretty strong.
	* Used interviews, administrative data, and leveraged other data to gather a rich set of variables on the boys (schools, psychologists, families, neighbors, criminal justice and social welfare officials).
	* Followed up with boys in 1950's and 1960's when they were adult men. Gathered information on marriage, residential mobility, children, military experience, employment history, public assistance, and academic achievement.
	* A large proportion of the sample had data on *serious* offenders as well!

## Direct effect of incarceration

* All delinquent youths were at some point incarcerated but the length of time varies considerably as well.
* When modeling the direct effects of incarceration, it does not appear to be deterrent or criminogenic for either juveniles or adults.
* Authors hypothesize, though, that incarceration has indirect effects through what they call *cumulative continuity*. It is very similar to ideas discussed from [[labeling theory]] and [[Secondary Deviance]] where the initial deviant act elicits hostile societal reactions which reinforces the deviant identity. In this case, formal criminal justice sanctions spark failure in school and employment weakening bonds to the community and making future deviant behavior more likely.
* Authors argue: 1) incarceration is highly stigmatizing and 2) incarceration prevents individuals from forming pro-social attachments (particularly at work) causing individuals to face substantial structural impediments to conventional lines of adult activity.

### Indirect effect of incarceration

* Regression modeling results find that length of juvenile incarceration has the largest overall effect on later job stability (regardless of prior crime and excessive adolescent drinking).
* Authors argue that incarceration cuts off opportunities and prospects for stable employment later in life (which in turn affects criminal propensity).

### Positive effects of incarceration

* Some individual case files found that some respondents during their interviews found juvenile detention to have had a very positive effect on them. A few things to note:
	* The boys noted that the staff were kind to them. Kind but firm and strict. Kept them under close supervision.
	* They were often visited by their family.
	* They spent a relatively short amount of time in juvenile detention (six and eight months compared to the average of 1.5 years).
