## Abstract

Drawing on a systematic assessment of the accumulated empirical literature and interviews with 25 race and sentencing scholars, this paper argues that the standard approach adopted in research on race and sentencing in criminology is insufficient for addressing the key underlying questions that motivate this work, including whether, where, how, and why race may matter. In light of this assessment, the paper lays out some additional directions for empirical research in this area that would bolster the validity and reliability of our knowledge about how race shapes sentencing and enhance the policy relevance of this work.

## My notes

#paper_idea -> important paper to consider in light of my dissertation.

### Overview

Provide an overview and critique of the existing literature on race and sentencing, highlighting the positive contributions of past and present approaches (regression-based and archival studies of sentencing outcomes) but also illuminating limitations and lays out some additional directions for research. Use literature review studies but also interviews with sentencing scholars.

### Background and Current Limitations of Research

Current Research -> Typical approach relies on archival data of those already sentenced using conventional regression approaches. The meta-goals of such work:

1. Detect racial disparity -> This non-experimental approach is of limited value in describing this issue. Large fraction of studies suffer from methodological issues like inadequate controls. Good studies consistently find small but significant effects for race. Slightly larger effects for probability of imprisonment rather than sentence length -> contingent upon many other factors.
    
	1. Conceptual Ambiguity -> Sentencing outcomes are prescribed/mandated rather than the judge’s decision. Inattention to various other sentencing actors (aside from the judge). “... these studies are modelling the effects of race but on whose decisions or at what decision-making stage?” Ignores how legislatures also affect these decisions.
    
	2. Omitted Variable Bias -> Class, marital status, victim attributes, witness cooperation, evidence.
    
	3. Sample Selection Bias -> Research may be biased because of differential group-based selection into the sentence length phase of the process (exists at every stage of the criminal justice system).
    
2. Detect racial discrimination -> different from disparity. Disparities can arise for a variety of reasons other than discrimination (even at just the sentencing phase). Discrimination can be like we normally imagine (white vs. black treated differently) or due to the rules being biased (whites more likely to sell cocaine, blacks more likely to sell crack, crack rules are harsher). Modal approach cannot shed any light on whether or not discrimination is present.
    
3. Assess how or why race influences legal decision makers and legal decisions.
    
	1. Too little attention paid to the indirect ways race can play a role (prior record, legal representation, pre-trial status). Some research tries to address this but most does not.
    
	2. Modal research rarely tells us much about the reasons for the noted indirect (or direct) effects of race. We don’t know how courtroom actors think.
    
4. Evaluating whether a given policy intervention has modified racial disparities -> these sorts of studies are rare. Most research is disconnected from public policy.

“This approach is not highly useful for shedding light about the sources or meaning of racial disparities in contemporary prison populations nor is it alone well suited for detecting race differences in sentencing… or advancing knowledge about why race may influence legal decision makers.” #quote

Racially disparate patterns can arise because of two extremes: racial differences in criminal participation and no bias in the application of the law OR racial equality in the prevalence, incidence, and nature of offending but total bias in how the law is applied -> disparities in prison populations can arise at various juncture points in the criminal justice system while the modal approach is only focused on assessing racial disparities in the sentencing of convicted defendants.

### Limitations from interviewing other researchers

1. Overly narrow treatment of race (treated as merely a demographic attribute but also ignoring race of victims, judges, attorneys, jurors, and other actors).
    
2. Relatively narrow scope conditions that define in the modal tradition when and where race may shape sentencing outcomes.  

3. Little attention has been paid to prosecutorial screening, pre-trial decisions, plea bargaining, and trial decisions (data availability issues).
    
4. Not enough attention paid to the role race plays in legislatures who are creating sentencing guidelines.
### Future Directions

- Borrow more liberally from other areas of study -> [[multistage regression]], [[propensity score matching]]. Perhaps adopt alternative estimation procedures? Lab/field experiments would be useful (mock trials, law students, members of the court community), borrow from hiring/lending and housing markets literature (ask prosecutors if they would seek death penalty after reading a case file).

- Experiments would help to explain why disparities arise -> policy implications.

- Explicitly model direct and indirect effects rather than including them as controls.

- Case narratives and qualitative research.

- Cognitive research and neurological research on how we make decisions.
