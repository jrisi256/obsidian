## Abstract

Children's health indicators such as mortality and adverse birth outcomes are poorer in the United States than in comparable nations. These measures also show racial inequities within the United States, with Black children experiencing the highest levels. Mass incarceration may partially explain these findings. High incarceration rates can disrupt community functioning, influencing behavior and health. The purpose of the current study was to conduct a macro (state)-level analysis examining whether yearly state incarceration rates predict health outcomes including infant, child, and teen mortality as well as preterm birth and low birth weight. It was hypothesized that prior year incarceration rates would show positive relationships with all outcomes and that relationships would be stronger for Black than for white children. Yearly state-level panel data were gathered from 1990 to 2017. Weighted least squares regression used states' prior year incarceration rates to predict child health outcomes, using controls for overall state effects and year-to-year effects. Time-varying covariates such as state unemployment rate were also included to address the possibility of spurious relationships. Results indicated that as hypothesized, incarceration rates positively predicted infant mortality, child mortality (for Black children only), preterm births, and low-weight births. Relationships tended to be stronger for Black than for white children.
## Mechanisms for mortality

Incarceration rates have been sufficiently high for sufficiently long that a large number of children have incarcerated family members, and the health effects on those children is enough to cumulatively influence statewide numbers.

1. Familial incarceration is a traumatic stressor to the child which will have negative health effects which can sometimes lead to mortality (e.g., higher risk of child homelessness, increased likelihood of engaging in risky and dangerous behavior).
2. High parental stress due to lower available support. High parental stress can lead to child neglect which can lead to greater unmet medical need and greater medical problems.

Those without an incarcerated family member may still be affected by the concentration of incarceration weakening their communities. The cycling in and out of incarceration disrupts community social networks and community members will have less individuals they can rely upon for help.

Mass incarceration is more likely to affect communities which are already stressed by economic, racial, and other inequities. The reduction in social capital may exacerbate existing neighborhood stressors. This in turn can exacerbate parental stress since they feel they have a lack of community support in raising the child.

The absence of family and community members should be felt quickly as children and affected family members should be immediately stressed. The community should also feel the reduction in social support.
## Mechanisms for adverse birth outcomes

There are stress-related pathways through which mass incarceration should affect birth outcomes. Expectant mothers could be stressed if a family member becomes incarcerated during the pregnancy. Expectant mothers in high-incarceration communities would be subject to the same spillover stress effects discussed above.

Stress affects the mother's neuroendocrine system which slows fetal development.

This is also hypothesized to begin within a relatively short time period (a matter of months).

## Data

1. Incarceration rates comes from the US Bureau of Justice Statistics and only capture state prisoners. Lagged by 1-year.
2. Child health outcomes came from a combination of the KIDS COUNT Data center and the CDC's Wonder Database. Infant mortality, child mortality, teen mortality, preterm birth, low birth weight.
3. Dummy variables for **state** and **year**. **Unemployment** (BLS), **median household income** (IPUMS-CPS), and **poverty** (CPS). **Education** (some college, finished high school, did not finish high school). **Social spending** on TANF, Medicaid, SSI, education spending, and SNAP (Urban Institute's State and Local Finance Initiative). **Percent of the population that is Black**.
4. Data spans 1990 - 2017.

## Methods

* Weighted (by state population) [[ordinary least squares]] regression.
* Estimated separately for each of the four outcome variables.
* Standard errors were adjusted using the [[Newey-West estimator]] to account for first-order serial autocorrelation.

## Results

* Significantly related to all outcomes (except child mortality). Higher incarceration rates were associated with lower teen mortality.
* Stratify models by race. Results are significant for all outcomes for Black children (not teen mortality). Results are only significant for infant mortality and preterm births for White children. Higher incarceration was associated with lower mortality for White teens.
