## Abstract

It is a truism that the administration of criminal justice consists of a series of discretionary decisions by police, prosecutors, judges, and other officials. Analyzing the origins, nature, and impact of various efforts to control discretion, Taming the System is the first comprehensive history of the reform attempts in the past forty years. Of enormous value to scholars, reformers, and criminal justice professionals, Walker's book approaches the discretion problem through a detailed examination of four decision points: policing, bail setting, plea bargaining, and sentencing. In a field which largely produces short-ranged "evaluation research", this study, in taking a wider historical approach, distinguishes between the roles of administrative bodies (the police) and evaluates the longer-term trends and the successful reforms in criminal justice history. Serving as an "interim report" on what does and does not work in the system, Taming the System concludes that not only has the effort to control discretion been a unifying theme in criminal justice history, but that there have actually been some successes, resulting in reducing disparities in race and social class.

## My notes

### Class Notes

- District Attorney → 1st Assistant / Deputy Chief → Bigger jurisdictions have units (major crimes, juvenile, homicide, rape, drug, organized), smaller jurisdictions have less units, very small jurisdictions won’t have units. All the assistants work under the DA.

- **Reasonable doubt standard** -> prosecutors only bring cases to trial for people they believe are guilty and can be proven as such vs. **Trial sufficiency standard** prosecutors bring cases to trial where they aren’t 100% sure of the guilt but think it’s likely → Defense attorneys don’t like this, reasonably so, you’re trying people who you don’t know are guilty.

- **Satisificing** → Critique of rational choice. We don’t weigh all the information, just some of it. We don’t make optimal decisions, we make good enough decisions. And we fill in the blanks with stereotypes, heuristics.
    
* **Innocent until proven guilty** → organizationally irrational in some sense. Even defense attorneys are working with this background assumption. Well, it’s likely most people here are guilty of something. **If written today**, Walker (Taming the System) may not have stated it so strongly (that virtually all people who get to the trial stage are guilty) → given what we now know about false confessions, false conviction rates, the power the state can bear.   

### Chapter 1

- **What’s the question** → What’s the appropriate way to deal with discretion within the criminal justice system? How can we enable its use in situations where it would be good and curb its use in situations where it would be bad?

	- “The criminal justice system is nothing more than the sum total of a series of discretionary decisions by innumerable officials.”
	  
	- “Do officials comply with rules? Do formal rules achieve their stated goals?”
	  
	- Other paths would include enabling discretion and relying upon training and professionalization.

- **How do you propose to answer it** → Discretion as an academic concept was discovered by accident basically. Calls for research during the 1950s to better understand our criminal justice system created our current _discretionary paradigm_. Earlier paradigms used the Progressive-era models (corruption and unqualified personnel were the problems, classist/political agenda to enhance the power of the middle class and weaken blue-collar workers and their political machines).

- **What do you find** → Criminal law is unrelated to the punishment of criminals many times. It has been fashioned into use for handling many different types of social problems. Police, prosecutors, and judges largely rely upon informal and hidden decision-making processes to handle all of this. **American Bar Foundation**.

- Dominant theme of criminal justice policy since the late 1950s has been to control discretion. This book examines that movement and tries to understand how effective it has been and how we might be more effective moving forward at solving our problems.

- Reservations of controlling discretion: **1)** Nothing works and reforms often backfire. **2)** Rules designed to control discretion become empty formalism or merely symbolic and may make things worse as individuals and organizations find ways to game the rules. **3)** Do rules designed to control discretion only serve to move it around?

- Moved from abolition to controlling discretion (since discretion is inescapable and sometimes it is good so it must be guided by rules).

- **Rule** → any formal directive designed to limit or control the discretion of a criminal justice official.

- Rules can (and should) develop from many sources (and not just the Supreme Court, we shouldn’t only focus on it!). **1)** What should the scope of the rule be? **2)** How detailed should it be? **3)** How narrowly should it attempt to confine discretion? **4)** What are the consequences for not following the rule?    

### Chapter 2

- Efforts to control police discretion stem from a desire to limit police misconduct and efforts have been focused on the Supreme Court (due to an unwillingness/inability by the other branches of federal government to do anything). It’s unfortunate because there are other ways to control discretion and other venues for achieving that change → author argues for **administrative rulemaking** or law enforcement agencies attempting to control officer discretion through their own rules.

- Controlling discretion isn’t about outlawing some options vs. others. It’s about encouraging one option over others. Especially since police officers have a variety of decisions to make at a variety of different junctures.

- **Use of deadly force** → “...control of deadly force is arguably the great success story in the long effort to control police discretion. It’s the one decision point where we have persuasive evidence documenting a positive impact of new rules without any unintended or undesirable consequences.” **Ironic?** #disagree #question 

- The NYPD led the way by adopting a highly restrictive policy on the use of deadly force in 1972. It should only be used in situations of imminent death or great bodily harm. This standard was achieved through conflict and community protests. Reports must then be filed after a firearm is discharged and reviewed. Crime didn’t go up and neither did attacks on officers (in fact they declined, de-escalation of violence and enhanced officer safety?).

- Will the success continue? Maybe not. Or maybe it will as it becomes more enshrined within policing practices and culture. These rule changes came about after bitter political fights. The Supreme Court had very little effect.

- **Domestic Violence** → Another movement to control police officer discretion. In the mid-1960’s, arrests were discouraged. Officers were trained to settle disputes and mediate them. It was part of the philosophy of rehabilitation and deinstitutionalization. Additionally officers were trained to only make arrests for serious matters. This changed in the 1970s and one reason was that women’s rights groups wanted the police to arrest their abusers. **Mandatory arrest laws**. Similar in some ways to deadly force (a minority group agitating for it) but dissimilar (fundamentally a conservative solution).

- Unclear if it really was effective at deterring future violence.

- Did officers follow these rules? Unlike deadly force, there were no reporting/review requirements, they’re much more common, not as public, not as morally charged, and they’re much more ambiguous (what is domestic violence?).

- And, of course, there’s still discretion!

- Aside from domestic violence, no attempts have been made to guide police arresting discretion.

- **Section on high speed police chases**. Controlling discretion around them.

- **Miranda** and **Mapp**. What have been the effects? **Conservatives** → Feared they would inhibit policing. Nope. It only affects a small number of cases. Some concern the police may lie more or may have become adept at evading Miranda requirements. But also some evidence it has limited grosser forms of coercion. **Liberals** → Hoped the Supreme Court alone could reform the police, nope.

- When it comes to warrants and exclusionary rule, some evidence to suggest they aren’t just merely symbolic (even if not perfect or close to it). Interesting study where in one department police officers were evaluated based on how often their evidence was suppressed in court. Caused the quality and training of police to vastly improve. Of course, they still wouldn’t always get a warrant if they weren’t intending to get a conviction (seize goods for money).
  
- **Conclusions** → Some control has been exerted over some police discretion. Many (most) decisions are still untouched. Not all the rules work as intended. Still forward progress is being made. Police are more accountable now than before (when before they were not accountable _**at all**_). Limited grossest forms of abuse (?), but arrests remain very unregulated. **Grounds for optimism** → administrative rule making and vigorous political advocacy can achieve control over discretion.

### Chapter 4

Discretion is a process and not a single decision point. Not easily amenable to policy attempting to control it and the discretion of individuals involved.

- **Decision Point #1** → Should criminal charges be filed or not? Evidence to suggest that prosecutor willingness to accept arrests (or not) changes police officer behavior as to what arrests to refer to the prosecutors (**not all arrests are presented to the prosecutor**).

- **Decision Point #2** → **Charge bargaining**. The defendant has been charged. What is going to be the _top charge_? **Horizontal overcharging** → Adding on charges where there is some evidence they happened but the prosecutor doesn’t seriously intend to pursue them. **Vertical overcharging** → Filing most serious top-level charge possible. Go high and bargain down.

- **Sentence bargaining** → Once the charges have been set, what’s going to be the sentence? “Making the crime fit the punishment.” Not possible in states with mandatory minimums.

- Lawyers shop for judges, police officers shop for assistant district attorneys.

- **Abolition**?

- Guilty pleas did not arise because of courtroom pressures or out of a desire to be efficient to get through all the cases we have to get through. **Plea negotiations** were abolished in Alaska (wasn’t much of a measurable impact) → cases did move through court much quicker. It did increase sentencing disparities (going to trial greatly increased sentence lengths) as judges became the primary _judges_ of the sentence, again.

- Abolishment moves discretion around? And forces bargaining to occur primarily around the sentence instead of the charges?

- Supermarket model → There is very little bargaining. High volume and high throughput at fixed prices. This can be achieved because most cases which survive this far typically involve people who are guilty. **Plea bargaining is highly routinized and predictable** → helps us understand why there wasn’t much effect in Alaska.

- Plea bargaining is tightly constrained **albeit by informal norms**.

- **Increase Visibility and Regulate It**
 
- Other reforms which generally improve the functioning of the prosecutor's office and screening out of weak cases leads to much less plea bargaining as a result (prosecutors are left with strong cases they feel comfortable taking to trial and thus aren’t inclined to bargain). **Enhanced sentence bargaining** and the power of the judge → New Orleans example.

- Increasing bureaucratization induced grumbling and discontent but eventually shifted norms and compliance.

- **System wide analysis** of reforms at attempts to control discretion.

- **Reforms** → Lawyers had to provide a **factual basis** for the plea (addressing the wrong problem), **increased judicial regulation** to ensure defendants understood implications of their plea (defendants already understand the implications but _correctly_ feel like they still have to accept the deal), **formal pretrial conferences** (no real effects seemingly not bad and some positive externalities perhaps).

- **Concluding notes** → 1960s ushered in a huge, unprecedented role for the defense attorney. Additionally, is bureaucratization so bad? It allows for the imposition of formal rules (of the kind we might like) against informal rules which may not be what we like.

	- But aren’t public defenders bad? And it’s just empty formalism. **Hard to say**. It’s certainly better than having _no representation at all_. **Warm body hypothesis** → mere presence acts as a check against prosecutors. Additionally, we have never really had a true adversarial system. It’s been highly routine for quite some time. So it’s quite unrealistic to believe public defenders would be passionately defending everyone in trial settings.
