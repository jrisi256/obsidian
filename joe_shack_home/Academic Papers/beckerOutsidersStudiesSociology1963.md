## My notes

### Chapter 1

* All social groups make rules and at some times under some circumstances they try to enforce them. The person labelled as a rule-breaker may or may not accept the legitimacy of the label and those who are handing out the labels (society at large/public, law enforcement, criminal justice system, etc.). How far one is outside the rules varies (traffic violators are just like us, thieves less so, murderers are true outsiders), and it also varies how legitimate/illegitimate the rule breaker views the rules (traffic violators often acknowledge their crime, alcoholics are ambivalent, drug addicts often have full-blown ideologies explaining why they’re right and society is wrong).
  
* “If scientists ignore the variable character of the process of judgment concerning what is and isn’t considered deviant (by taking it as a given or inherent), they may limit the kinds of theories that can be developed and the kind of understanding that can be achieved.” #quote 
  
* Prior definitions of deviance:
	1) Statistical. A bit too broad since it encompasses left-handed people and redheads.
	2) Deviance is something pathological akin to a disease. Also too limited as it is too accepting of the social norms of the day (and giving them objective status) and locates the source of deviancy in the individual, preventing us from seeing that societal judgment plays an important role.
	3) Related sociological definition is one in which acts that are deviant are acts which are functional or dysfunctional towards achieving the goals of society. What is considered deviant is often a political question at the societal level (as are the goals).
	4) Deviance is a failure to obey group rules. Too ambiguous concerning what happens in the case of following one set of rules you break another.
	
	* **Definition** -> Social groups create deviance by making the rules and then applying those rules. It is not a quality of the act of the person but a consequence of the application by others of rules and sanctions. The deviant is one to whom the label has been successfully applied. Thus there can be misapplications of the rules (some people mislabeled). Also there will be people who are deviant and weren’t successfully labelled as such. As such, limited progress to be made concerning personal and social characteristics and treating deviants as an homogeneous group.

* “Whether an act is deviant depends on how other people react to it.” -> great example from studying a native tribe, people wouldn’t sanction the act (except for gossip) until the interested party whipped them into a frenzy about it. Conversely, you may not have broken a rule, but you could still be treated like you did. #quote 
  
* Variations in community response -> When it takes place, who commits the act, who feels harmed by the act, some rules are only enforced when they result in certain outcomes.
  
* Deviation is thus not a quality present in some kinds of objective behaviors and not others, it is the product of a process which involves responses of other people to the behavior. Cannot know if a behavior will be labeled as deviant until we know the response of others.
  
* Another angle is the fact that rules are made by groups and can often lead to conflicting behaviors/attitudes between groups. Thus the perspective of those labeled as deviant is quite likely to be very different from those who condemn the behavior. An important question of who can force others to accept their roles and why are they successful in doing so? Economic/political power. In many instances, one group is forcing another group through coercion without their consent or input to follow their rules.

### Chapter 2

* **Four types**: Conforming, deviant, secret deviant, falsely accused. Ignoring the differences between these types leads to the fallacy of trying to explain different things in the same way when they may in fact require different explanations (even for the same objective action).
  
* Multivariate regression analysis assumes each factor produces the phenomenon simultaneously. This may not always be the case. Take the marijuana user example. It’s a sequential process of becoming more and more involved in smoking marijuana. So what may explain initial behavior or first steps may no longer be so important in subsequent steps (availability of marijuana may be highly predictive for novices but not for regular users who may go to greater lengths to obtain it).
  
* Should consider a “career” approach to crime and try to understand why some careers are short-lived and others are much longer.
  
* Why do people commit deviant acts in the first place? Some do so quite unknowingly (very enmeshed in a subculture, not aware of larger culture) or by accident. We may be going down the wrong road in assuming everyone must have some sort of motivation for committing a deviant act (maybe it’s better to ask why people don’t follow their fleeting, deviant impulses) -> forerunner of Hirschi and [[Social control theory|social control]] -> so some people are nonconforming because they have less stakes in conformity, also mentions [[sykesTechniquesNeutralizationTheory1957]] for those who do have stakes in conformity -> mentions [[mertonSocialStructureAnomie1938]].
  
* For people who develop more in-depth careers in crime, they develop deviant motives and interests which are socially learned. Learns to participate and see some benefits/pleasures for engaging in the deviant subculture. Thus deviant motivations have a social character.
  
* Auxiliary and master traits (master trait of doctor is their certificate to practice medicine, auxiliary traits include they’re white, male, upper-middle class and Protestant). Same process happens when someone gets labelled as deviant. Master/subordinate statuses -> Race is a master status and tends to override all other statuses. Same goes for being labeled a criminal -> self-fulfilling prophecy sets in, cuts them off from conventional activities, forces them to become deviant in other areas of their life, caught again and the cycle continues.

* “The behavior is a consequence of the public reaction to the deviance rather than a consequence of the inherent qualities of the deviant act.” #quote 
  
* The prophecy is avoided if when the individuals are first sanctioned they still have the ability to choose alternate lines of action. Welcomed back to the community rather than further shunned (drug addicts attempting to come clean are often still treated as junkies).
  
* Becoming part of an organized group of deviants is often the final step in solidifying one’s deviant identity. From the group forms a subculture. Begin to rationalize their position, neutralize the values of mainstream culture and even repudiate it. Create reasons for continuing their activity. Principled deviance. Learns how to conduct deviant activities with minimum trouble both internally and externally.

### Chapter 3

* Individualized theories of marijuana usage are inadequate. Cannot explain why large numbers of individuals engage in the behavior who lack the specific trait. Have difficulty in explaining why an individual’s behavior pattern changes so much over time in regards to using the drug.
  
* Stated simply the thesis, “... instead of the deviant motives leading to the deviant behavior… the deviant behavior in time produces the deviant motivation. Vague impulses and desires… are transformed into definite patterns of action through the social interpretation of a physical experience…” Trying to chart the sequence the changes in attitudes which lead to marijuana usage -> Not addictive, so people use it recreationally. #quote 
  
* [[Analytic induction]] pops up again. Every case collected must substantiate the hypothesis. Explanation must always occur when an individual uses marijuana for pleasure, and the explanation never occurs or is permanently maintained when the person was unwilling to use marijuana for pleasure.
  
* It isn’t a random sample. Only 50 people. Interviews. Step 1 is to learn proper smoking technique otherwise you’ll get nothing out of it and therefore won’t continue using it. Through group teaching, they learn the proper way to smoke -> ashamed and so they learn through imitation and discreetly observing.
  
* Step 2 is the onset of symptoms and then teaching people those symptoms are the symptoms of getting high. Those experiences must be connected to the smoking of the marijuana. The concept of getting high is acquired through interactions with others, discussing it, doing it together. So drug use became fun not only for the effects but also learning to perceive those effects. This is how marijuana use becomes ascribed meaning. Some evidence suggests people who lose the ability to perceive getting high (because of other drugs or other reasons) stop using.
	* Over time you become comfortable with it, and you become like an expert in fine wine. You can appreciate the subtlety.
	  
* One final step is learning to enjoy the effects. Not inherently pleasurable. And our tastes are socially acquired. Sometimes even experienced users can smoke too much, so to speak. If this causes them to stop socializing with other marijuana users, they’re likely to think of the drug as pleasurable and will stop using it. On the other hand, if they keep socializing, they’re likely to keep viewing it as pleasurable, and their unpleasant experience was an aberration.
  
* In conclusion, “... develops a disposition or motivation to use marijuana which was not and could not have been present when use began for it involves and depends on conceptions of the drug which could only grow out of the kid of actual experience detailed…” #quote 
  
* As long as it remains fun, its use will always be a possibility regardless of morality and expediency.

### Chapter 4

* Learning to enjoy marijuana is a necessary condition for using marijuana, but it isn’t a sufficient condition. Not everybody who enjoys marijuana goes on to use it. Most contend with societal forces of control. When deviant behavior emerges, one reason it emerges is because of a breakdown in social controls which normally regulate that behavior.
  
* “Important factors in the genesis of deviant behavior may be sought in the processes by which people are emancipated from the controls of society and become responsible to those of a smaller group.” #quote 
  
* Social control, in one way, through power and sanctions. Other ways of exerting control exist as well (perceptions around the action, feasibility of engaging in it, people of high status opining on the action) -> deviant behavior arises when sanctions are ineffective and the illegitimate behavior comes to be seen as legitimate.
  
* Beginner -> occasional user -> regular user. For marijuana, people are kept from using it through 1) supply, 2) users having to hide from nonusers, 3) and cultural definition of the act as immoral.

	1. For supply, you become involved with groups who have access (and thus will have values in opposition to the mainstream). To supply yourself with a steady stream and to become a regular user, you need to become more involved and more engrossed. Eventually develop a reputation as a trustworthy person. Threat of arrest can be an impediment to start, but once it’s overcome the threat of sanction is no longer seen as overbearing. Can be mitigated through common-sense. By controlling the supply, people’s use of the drug is sporadic. Threat of sanction isn’t so much a deterrent. “... changes in group participation and membership lead to changes in level of use by affecting the individual’s access…” #quote 
	   
	2. People are afraid when first starting out if others will find out they’re using as they’ll lose respect and status. Increasing association with groups where it’s common to smoke marijuana reassures the user they can safely use without nonusers finding out. More regular users will find out ways to limit contact with nonusers or carry on without nonusers knowing through control of symptoms. This adaptation is necessary to graduate from occasional user to regular user.
	   
	3. People come up with rationalizations as to why the drug being morally wrong is itself wrong. One reason is that people engage in much more harmful practices like drinking alcohol, legally. People say the drug really only has beneficial effects. Also users, since it’s not addictive, can schedule time to use and not use the drug and feel good that it’s not controlling them (regular users engage in this as well to convince themselves they haven’t become a dope fiend).

### Chapter 7

* When are the rules enforced? -> entrepreneur (someone must take the initiative in punishing the act), personal interest, publicity (all conditioned by the character of the organization where the rule enforcement takes place).
  
* Urban center residents practice “reserve” where in anonymous highly public areas where they know nobody they feel assured that nothing happening is their responsibility. Somebody else (professional law enforcers) can take care of it. The agreement to ignore these rules rests on this assumption. Not all places are like this however in cities.
  
* Sometimes two groups in conflict find mutual advantage in having infractions go unpunished. Management lets the X-Ray technician steal food from the hospital because they realize they don’t pay him enough. Management may allow a rule to go unenforced because it’s too cumbersome to enforce. Etc. Enforcement only happens once the compromise put in place to serve everybody’s interest is no longer feasible (depends on relative power of competing groups and access to publicity).
  
* Values are poor guides of action because they cannot deal with the complexity of life, and we often hold competing values without realizing it until we are presented with a situation which reveals this. Thus values are starting places for the generation of more specific rules. Values get translated into rules to deal with problems (not an automatic process, contradictory rules could flow from the same value or maybe certain rules which would seem obvious to implement given some value hasn’t been implemented) -> rules are thus carefully crafted to be narrow and precise enough so as to deal with only the specific problem at hand (obscenity laws and free speech laws).
  
* The specific rule will then be selectively enforced in certain situations among certain peoples at certain times.
  
* Of course some rules don’t flow from value but merely an attempt to organize some activity fairly. And some enforcement may stretch or outright invent some rules.
  
* In any case, since this process isn’t naturalistic by any means and instead highly socially constructed. We must turn to the moral entrepreneurs who make it their business to interpret certain values so as to get certain rules passed and who expect the rule to be enforced in the way they perceive. Usually have a personal interest in doing so and employ publicity to get the public and other organizations on their side and raise awareness of the issue and the need for something to be done about it (in the way they want) -> media plays a big role here.

### Chapter 8 - Moral Entrepreneurs

* Rules are the products of someone’s initiative, and we can think of these initiators as moral entrepreneurs.
  
* Rule Creators -> Crusading reformer. The current rules do not satisfy them. Can be self-righteous, a bit totalizing, paint the problem in stark, black-and-white terms. However their concerns usually also come from a place of humanitarian concern and not just a need to tell other people what to do or a need to feel better about themselves vs. everybody else. Many crusaders are members of the upper class. Tend to not concern themselves with the means necessary for achieving their ends… can produce odd coalitions.
	* They depend a lot upon the advice of experts.
	  
* Don’t care too much about the finer details of the implementation. Can allow for other interests to creep in and unforeseen influences. In any case, successful crusades usually end in new rules with appropriate enforcement mechanisms in place. However the Crusader will also find themselves out of a job and may move on to other Crusades (especially true of organizations).
  
* Unsuccessful crusades either reform their mission statement or double down and become “moralizers-in-retreat” bitter at a society that abandoned them.
  
* Rule Enforcers -> Institutionalizes the crusade. Creates a new class of outsiders. In any case, the rule enforcers probably don’t have the same zeal the original crusaders had. Only interested in enforcing the rules, whatever they may be however much they may change.
  
* In justifying their position, they must constantly assure people the problem still exists. But they also must show their attempts to control the problem are working. Also self-interest in the perpetuation of their position. Tend to be skeptical of the ability to reform people -> reinforced by daily experience of only dealing with rule breakers (perhaps they’re pessimistic because they have to be, otherwise they’d be out of a job).
  
* The enforcers also need to garner the respect of the people they’re working with and dealing with otherwise their job will be impossible. Sometimes someone can then be labeled a deviant for disrespecting a rule enforcer.
  
* Because the rule enforcer cannot enforce every instance of rule-breaking, they have to prioritize. Sometimes they’ll avoid people or people with sufficient resources and know-how can avoid sanctions (see fixers for helping thieves). Amateur thieves let go while the professionals usually get away (and in fact the amateurs allow for the occasional professional to go free).
  
* Rule enforcers thus have their own priorities in terms of rule enforcement. And there other pressures pushing down on them as well in terms of if they will or will not enforce a law in a particular situation. Tension between rule enforcers and rule creators.
