## Abstract

Hirschi studies data and rejects the two prevailing theories -- the criminal is either one who is a frustrated striver forced into deliquency by his acceptance of goals common to us all or one who is an innocent foreigner attempting to obey the rules of a society that is not in a position to make the law or define "evil" conduct. Rather he states the case that delinquents are often free of serious intimate attachments, aspirations, and moral beliefs that bind most people under [[Social control theory|social control theory]].

## My notes

### Introduction

* “... sees in the delinquent a person relatively free of the intimate attachments, the aspirations, and the moral beliefs that bind most people to a life within the law.” #quote
  
* Insofar as one respects (loves and fears) the law, they will accept the rules. As respect is undermined, rules lose their obligatory power (attachment and belief). Of course, other factors come into play which make rule-following more obligatory even if you don’t completely respect them (commitment and involvement).

### Chapter 1

Three prominent alternative theories: 

1. [[anomie|Strain theory]] -> a person is blocked from achieving legitimate goals through legitimate means, but they turn to deviance.
	1. Criticisms of this theory -> Talks about *maturational reform* and how strain theory cannot deal with it, and it seems bound to only explain crime among lower classes (although this is not really true).
	2. One criticism I sort of get behind -> very hard to falsify anomie theory because it’s very hard to measure aspirations and expectations at the same time accurately. Argues that many delinquents do not feel deprived or blocked.
	   
2. Control/bond theory - a person is free to commit delinquent acts because their ties to the conventional order have been broken.
    
4. [[differential association|Differential association]] and[[cultural deviance]] -> The deviant conforms to a set of standards not accepted by a larger or more powerful society. Again Hirschi’s criticisms betray his lack of understanding of differential association. Some parts kind of stick for me (differential association is filled with tautologies, is non-falsifiable, doesn’t do well on empirical predictions). I certainly don’t think his theory is going to do any better, though. Repeats Kornhauser critique that are no bad actions in this theory since from the point of view of the actor, they’re acting correctly.

Hard to reconcile the assumptions underlying these theories. We should not be trying to integrate theories with very different underlying assumptions and which are fundamentally very different.

### Chapter 2 - Control Theory

* Delinquent acts result when an individual’s bond to society is weak or broken. Of course doesn’t make it a certainty, but it does make it more likely.
* The four elements of a bond:
  
	* **Attachment**:
	  
		* Long interlude about psychopathy and how it’s a circular definition. “... lack of attachment to others is to be free from moral restraints… it is psychopathy; lack of conscience is just another way of saying the same things, and the violation of norms is or may be a consequence.”
		  
		* Impulsivity and aggressiveness can also be consequences as freedom from moral restraint.
		  
		* Norms of society are shared by the members of society -> to violate a norm is to act contrary to the wishes and expectations of other people -> And if you don’t care about the opinions of others, that means you don’t care about their norms, and you’re free to deviate.
		  
		* The essence of internalization of norms, conscience, or superego thus lies in the attachment of the individual to others.
		  
		* A person’s attachment can be measured independently of their deviant actions -> gets into discussion about why he dislikes psychology and its circular use of terms.
		  
	* **Commitment**:
	  
		- The rational component in conformity, Hirschi labels commitment. Call it fear if you want. Calculated rewards vs. costs. Skin in the game if you will. A person willingly takes action to invest themselves in something. When considering deviant behavior, you now run the risk of losing your investment. Ignorance and error thus appear as reasons for deviance as the person gets the calculation wrong so to speak.
		  
		- Most people simply by living in organized society acquire stakes in it and thus these accumulations are society’s insurance that people will follow the rules.
		  
	- **Involvement**:
	  
		- People only have limited time, energy, and resources. People are too busy doing legitimate things to become involved with illegitimate things. It’s why recreational facilities in high schools are so stressed. Keep teens busy and not idle.
		  
	- **Belief**:
	  
		- Assume existence of a common value system within the society whose norms are being violated. Assume the deviant believes the rules and assume the deviant believes the rules even as they violate them. How is this possible?
		  
			- **Approach 1**: Semantic dementia. Beliefs are merely vocal expressions with little meaning when other controls aren’t present.
			  
			- **Approach 2**: The deviant rationalizes their behavior so they can violate the rule while still believing in it. Thinks techniques of rationalization.
			  
		- Hirschi instead says, instead, moral obstacles are removed. Neutralization not required. Many people don’t have an attitude of respect towards the rules of society and don’t feel personal moral obligation to conform.
		  
		- Person’s beliefs in the moral validity of norms are weakened, for no teleological reason. Probability of deviancy increases. No special motivation is thus needed to explain the weakness of beliefs or the delinquent act itself. Key assumption -> variation in the belief in the moral validity of social rules.
		  
		- The idea of a common (single) value system is consistent with the fact of variation in the strength of belief in that value system. Does not suggest delinquency is based on counter-norms or that delinquents don’t believe delinquent acts are wrong. May very well think the acts are wrong, but the efficacy of such beliefs are contingent upon other beliefs and the strength of ties to conventional order.

#### What are we attached to?

It’s been rather hard to create a hierarchy of things people are attached to. Is attachment to family more important than attachment to school? Hirschi leaves this up to empirical observation rather than theoretical pondering.

#### What’s the motivation?

OK, still, why do people commit crime? Some control theorists appealed to our animal nature. Dogs when assaulting other dogs or destroying the pillow don’t commit moral acts. It’s simply their behavior. Same too with humans once civilization is removed.

1. Motivation to crime is constant across persons. Everybody has criminal impulses at roughly the same frequency.
   
2. “The desires of man are in themselves not sinful. The actions which proceed from those desires aren’t sinful either until they encounter a law which forbids them.” #quote 
   
3. Some search for motivations. Some argue it’s situationally motivated. Some argue other things. In any case, they may be compatible with control theory but aren’t deducible from it.
   
4. In any case, Hirschi argues, the deviant is attempting to satisfy the same desires as any other person but due to low attachment, belief, commitment, and involvement commits crime. So Hirschi is sort of arguing, we don’t need to really consider motivation.

“The question of ‘Why do people deviate?’ is simply not the question the theory is designed to answer. The question is, ‘Why don’t we deviate?’” #quote

### Chapter 6 - Attachment to Parents

The bond of affection for conventional persons is a major deterrent to crime. The stronger this bond, the more likely the person is to take it into account when and if they contemplate committing a crime. Even if they do commit a crime, through greater efforts to avoid detection and generally being more risk-averse, prove the power of their attachment.

#### Attachment to Conventional Parents

* Delinquents are less likely than non-delinquents to be closely tied to their parents. Hirschi argues this is because of the primacy they have in socializing the child and teaching them to internalize societal norms. Alienate a child from the parent, these processes don’t occur. Lack of attachment (not just physical detachment mind you).
  
* How do we explain changes in delinquency as children get older? We acknowledge that attachment to persons is variable and changes over time. Goes through ebbs and flows.
  
* The direct physical control a parent exerts over the child is of little importance in explaining deviance. What is important is whether or not the parent is psychologically present when temptation to commit a crime appears. Children worry about parental reactions and inasmuch as they don’t care about parental reaction, they are free to commit the act. And children who worry most about parental reaction are those who know that their parents know where they are and whom they’re with. Thus the more the child shares their mental life with their parents, the more accustomed they are to seeking opinions of their activities, the more likely they are to perceive them as part of their social/psychological field, less likely to neglect their opinion when considering an act contrary to law.
  
* This plays out in the fact that children with more intimate communication commit less self-reported deviant acts. Respect their parents’ opinions.

#### Attachment to Unconventional Parents

* Are some children likely to be delinquent because of attachment to parents? Differential association might suggest you’re more likely to become deviant if exposed to pro-criminal messaging from parents. Does attachment to unconventional parents lead to more/less delinquency? No relationship
  
* Hirschi finds that intimacy of communication with their father doesn’t seem to have much impact on delinquency. Both children with low and high intimacy have high levels of delinquency (this is among a sub-sample of the children who had high self-reported levels of delinquency).
	* However by slicing up the data by father’s occupation, finds intimacy of communication connection for African-Americans and White-Americans. **The more intimate the communication, the less delinquency**.
	  
* Attachment to unconventional persons/institutions still associated with less deviancy.

#### Attachment and Exposure to Criminal Influences

* Differential association supporters argue, though, family detachment in a community with no other pro-criminal messages will not produce criminal behavior. No learning going on. Thus the lack of parental attachment is one part of the whole.
  
* Hirschi claims though on Table 25, strong evidence for control theory and not differential association. The intimacy of communication produces strong effects even when slicing the data up by number of friends the focal child had picked up the police. Within each category of number of friends picked up, children with lower intimacy had higher rates of self-reported delinquency.

#### Mothers vs. Fathers vs. Single-parent households

* “... one-parent family is virtually as efficient a delinquency-controlling institution as the two-parent family…” when intimacy is there I’m assuming. Goes on to find it’s very likely the case knowing the child’s attitude towards one parent is highly correlated with their attitudes towards the other parent. Very little love mother, hate father type scenarios. Thus, it doesn’t add much to understanding delinquency to add both parents’ relationships to the model.

#### Conclusion

* Finds no class distinctions. As long as children are attached to their parents, class does not seem to matter. Also does not find variation in attachment by social class, either.
  
* “... absence of control increases likelihood of delinquency regardless of the presence of group traditions of delinquency. Although social support \[of crime] increases the likelihood of delinquency, the view the child must somehow be taught crime in intimate, personal groups overstates the case." #quote 
  
* “In short, data suggest there are no groups of substantial proportions in American society that encourage crime in the sense that those belonging to the groups in question would prefer their children to follow their own rather than a conventional way of life.” #quote

### Limitations

* Underestimates companionship factor. Group processes are important and cannot be predicted solely from individual characteristics.
  
* Going along with that, underestimates the importance of friends.
  
* Overestimated the significance of involvement in conventional activities. Attachment seems more important.
  
* Fail to account for what delinquency *does for* the juvenile. E.g. effects on status and self-esteem.
