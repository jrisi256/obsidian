## Abstract

Research in the area of corrections is expansive in its breadth, impressive in its depth, and grows with each year that passes. We know so much more about the correctional enterprise than we knew even just a decade ago, and yet there is still so much uncharted territory and so much we could learn. In this article, we review key research findings in the four areas of mass incarceration, community corrections, institutional corrections, and prisoner reentry. We focus specifically on the past 10 years and, with an eye toward mapping uncharted or underexplored territory, we offer directions for future research in these areas. Although it is impossible to provide a comprehensive roadmap for future corrections research, we hope to have identified sufficient new directions to further (and perhaps even complicate) understandings of corrections in the broader context of justice research.

## Highlighted Notes

### [[Mass incarceration]]

#### Explanations

* Fundamental cultural changes have changed the way we see social problems.
* Economic crises necessitate the need to control excess populations and greater economic precarity.
* Political ideology -> increasing conservatism and weaponizing fear of crime for political gain (see public opinion and fear of crime).
* Racism -> [[alexanderNewJimCrow2012]].

We need better understandings of how mass incarceration played out differently across the USA (sub-national level and sub-state level). -> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BW6CPS92?page=623&annotation=VXZMNGMA)

#### Effects

* **Impact on individuals and families**:
	* Negative impacts on the incarcerated (employment and earnings).
	* Negative impacts on families (likelihood of marriage, higher chances of separation and single-parent households).
	* Negative impacts on children (mental health, behavioral problems, school problems).
	  
* **Impact on communities and crime**:
  
	* See [[Robert J. Sampson]]. Two phases of mass incarceration research.
		* Phase 1 was focused on its crime control effects through [[Deterrence theory|deterrence theory]] and [[Incapacitation effect]].
		* Phase 2 was focused on its criminogenic effects.
		  
	* Proposed phase 3 -> Comprehensive societal account of causal pathways which capture the simultaneous null, positive, and negative effects on crime at different time horizons. -> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BW6CPS92?page=625&annotation=RIMATYZ7) #paper_idea 
		* Researchers argue mass incarceration puts a great deal of strain on neighborhoods. These strains are particularly acute in those places where they are incarcerated and then released back into -> [[prison cycling]]. Ideas of [[cumulative disadvantage]].

#paper_idea -> Longitudinal models with very granular data would be helpful.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BW6CPS92?page=626&annotation=P4K9T6P3) “Despite growing work in this area (Bushway Et Paternoster, 2009), our understanding of the impact of incarceration on crime is still tenuous, perhaps in part because much of the deterrence and incapacitation research suffers from problems in unit of analysis. Most studies use national-level data on state incarceration and crime rates to show how differences in state incarceration policies affect state-level crime. While incarceration policy structures do occur at the state level, crime is quite local, and local decision-making produces the actualized crime policy as it is experienced locaLly. Thus, state-level analyses may mask important local variations, resulting in misestimating effects (Kovandzic Et Vieraitis, 2006; Vieraitis, Kovandzic, Et Marvell, 2007). New research has also pointed to stability of crime rates at very small geospatiaL units, such as street segments (Groff, Weisburd, Et Yang, 2010). Thus, crime concentrates longitudinally just as incarceration does suggesting that studies of incarceration and crime using very local units of analysis would be fruitful. Such analyses would need to separate the effects of removal of people for imprisonment from the effects of their return. Longitudinal models of the localized impact of incarceration on crime might help us better understand the long-term impact of mass incarceration on public safety.” ([Frost and Clear, 2012, p. 626](zotero://select/library/items/TIFCPWB9)) 

#### End of Mass Incarceration?

Economic crises and more active judiciary have led to reductions in prison populations.

* What are the best ways to safely reduce our prison populations?
* Does decreasing our reliance on prisons increase crime?
* How will decarceration effects vary across different places?

### Community Corrections

#### Jails

We need to study them more to better understand how they're similar but also different from prisons. [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BW6CPS92?page=627&annotation=VAEWFXNY)

Overlapping research with prisons. Most of the current research is geared towards practitioners.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BW6CPS92?page=628&annotation=XXZN2L78) “The same questions that apply to prison incarceration also apply to jail incarceration: How does jail confinement concentrate spatially? What are the collateral consequences for people who go to jail and for those who are related to them? What is the impact of length of stay in jail on recidivism? A strategic program to increase our knowledge about jails would provide a major step forward in correctional knowledge” ([Frost and Clear, 2012, p. 628](zotero://select/library/items/TIFCPWB9))

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BW6CPS92?page=628&annotation=S2AE9CDU) “Spawned by a decade long problem of litigation over poor jail conditions, especially crowding, much of the empirical work on jails appears in policy reports and limited distribution studies, and focuses on the problem of jail population management” ([Frost and Clear, 2012, p. 628](zotero://select/library/items/TIFCPWB9))

How well does jail work as a pre-trial option to ensure someone comes to trial and does not recidivate?

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BW6CPS92?page=628&annotation=HXVQ8DT9) “It is generally thought that pre-trial alternatives to detention perform very well compared to traditional bail, but most of this work is more than a decade old. Much of it focuses on jail population reduction, and not on the comparative effectiveness of different release strategies.” ([Frost and Clear, 2012, p. 628](zotero://select/library/items/TIFCPWB9)) 

How do we deal with mental illness in jails?

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BW6CPS92?page=628&annotation=AAPIW44M) “Additionally, one of the most pressing problems facing correctional administrators today is the dramatic increase in the number of mentally ill people incarcerated in jails” ([Frost and Clear, 2012, p. 628](zotero://select/library/items/TIFCPWB9)) 

We need to better understand the role of the local jail in the larger system as something distinct from prisons.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BW6CPS92?page=629&annotation=5MEXIVL4) “The role of jails in the larger corrections system is also not well understood. California's policy decision to realign and divert some of its prison population to local jails (California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, 2012) is but a highly visible contemporary manifestation of what we have long known: there is a reciprocal relationship between local jail policy and state correctional populations.” ([Frost and Clear, 2012, p. 629](zotero://select/library/items/TIFCPWB9))

#### Probation

Even compared to jails, probation has hardly been researched at all.

#### Intermediate Sanctions

Understudied, efficacy unknown, and do they just lead to more incarceration?

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BW6CPS92?page=631&annotation=7FB6VF93)“ The original arguments for intermediate sanctions were that they advance justice by offering judicial alternatives that save money and increase public safety. This assertion has not been very well tested empirically. Indeed, the track record of many so-called 'alternatives to incarceration,'' that they often result in more incarceration (Cohen, 1985), should make us worry that a close study of intermediate sanctions would find reasons for disappointment in them (Homant Et DeMercurio, 2009).” ([Frost and Clear, 2012, p. 631](zotero://select/library/items/TIFCPWB9)) 

### Institutional Corrections

What can we do to improve the programming within prisons as well as the physical spaces themselves? -> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BW6CPS92?page=631&annotation=P5WRYQLQ)

What can we do to help improve prisoner reentry? -> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BW6CPS92?page=634&annotation=VYDT4Y3K)

#### Parole

We have a hard time identifying the effects of parole, and it is outlined how hard it is to identify strategies which help to reduce rearrest.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BW6CPS92?page=634&annotation=Z9GGUFL3) “The impact of parole on parolees and their communities is one of the significant lines of research in this area. For at least the past decade, The Urban Institute has been conducting a series of studies of reentry with a major focus on parole (Brooks, Solomon, Keegan, Kohl, Et Lahue, 2005; Burke et al., 2008; Janetta Et Horvath, 2011). The Urban Institute's work is an exemplar of the burgeoning research having to do with people reentering society from prison and has contributed immensely to our knowledge of how supervision works, whether parole release reduces crime, and what works in parole.” ([Frost and Clear, 2012, p. 634](zotero://select/library/items/TIFCPWB9))

#### Desistance

* Two somewhat competing traditions: **desistance research** (see [[Life course theory|life-course]]) which focuses on things like work and marriage vs. **correctional programming** which focuses on [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] and individualized approaches. -> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BW6CPS92?page=635&annotation=79NQFYXA)

### Justice Innovation

* [[Justice reinvestment]]:

	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BW6CPS92?page=637&annotation=WI4VEKBG) “The goal of the justice reinvestment movement is to redirect some portion of the $54 billion the USA now spends on prisons to rebuilding the human resources and physical infrastructure (the schools, healthcare facilities, parks, and public spaces) of neighborhoods devastated by high levels of incarceration.” ([Frost and Clear, 2012, p. 637](zotero://select/library/items/TIFCPWB9))
	  
	* Is this happening still anywhere? [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BW6CPS92?page=637&annotation=X9B4AIRC) “Justice reinvestment is an innovation with no obvious downside. Although there is considerable momentum for the model, there can be no doubt that it is an idea still in its infancy. Only a handful of reinvestment projects have been mounted, and no strong empirical base yet exists about the strategy. But even so, based on the activity to date, justice reinvestment is an idea to be reckoned with.” ([Frost and Clear, 2012, p. 637](zotero://select/library/items/TIFCPWB9))

### Future Work

* Further understand how the criminal justice system impacts racial disparities.
* Understand how politics can constrain policy options.
* Expand beyond the USA in terms of correctional research.
