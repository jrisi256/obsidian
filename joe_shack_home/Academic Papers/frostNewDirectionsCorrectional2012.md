## Abstract

Research in the area of corrections is expansive in its breadth, impressive in its depth, and grows with each year that passes. We know so much more about the correctional enterprise than we knew even just a decade ago, and yet there is still so much uncharted territory and so much we could learn. In this article, we review key research findings in the four areas of mass incarceration, community corrections, institutional corrections, and prisoner reentry. We focus specifically on the past 10 years and, with an eye toward mapping uncharted or underexplored territory, we offer directions for future research in these areas. Although it is impossible to provide a comprehensive roadmap for future corrections research, we hope to have identified sufficient new directions to further (and perhaps even complicate) understandings of corrections in the broader context of justice research.
