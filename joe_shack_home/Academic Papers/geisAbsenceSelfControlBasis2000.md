## Abstract

It is now approaching a decade since Michael Gottfredson and Travis Hirschi promulgated what they called 'a general theory' of crime. This article scrutinizes the claims made by the theory as measured against the standards of science and the results of empirical inquiries into elements of the proposed theoretical construct.

## My notes

The authors issues with Gottfredson and Hirschi's [[Social control theory|social control]] and self-control general theories of crime can be divided up into the following categories.

1. Definition of crime -> doesn’t extend cross-culturally, different crimes likely involve different explanations, not all law-breaking is short-term focused, some crime is career-focused, not all crime is thrilling or harms others.
   
2. Tautological -> G&H don’t define self-control separately from the propensity to commit crimes. It’s possible some independent indicator of low self-control could be devised and related to separate measures of criminal behavior. G&H argue criminal offenses can be measures of self-control (even if low self-control doesn’t always lead to crime hence the statement it could be measured independently). This also comes from an Akers paper.
   
3. Discussion of criminal law -> Self-control does not seem to explain terrorism, prostitution, or campaign finance crimes.
   
4. Inclusion of acts analogous to crime -> not all disease and accidents arise from low self-control, lack of self-control cannot differentiate smokers and nonsmokers. “Not a theory of crime but of risk-taking behaviors… which would include things like skydiving.” How does the theory deal with things which were crimes but are no longer? E.g. homosexuality and abortion?
   
5. Exceptions to the theory -> since not all instances of low self-control lead to crime, how much leeway can we give the theory before we can dismiss it?
   
6. The concept of opportunity -> used as a stopgap solution to cover up any holes in their theory which might arise and not be covered by self-control.
   
7. Specialization in criminal behavior -> contrary to G&H’s claims, offenders do specialize.
   
8. Age-crime curve -> don’t offer much in the way of an explanation as to why people desist from crime as they get older.
   
9. White-collar crime -> theory woefully does horribly in explaining white-collar crime which takes much planning and logistical work and is embedded within an organizational context.
   
10. Research on the theory -> finds the empirical work not very supportive.
    
11. Ideological issues -> ignore the structural issues which afflict people, and it reflects in their policy recommendations which “would return responsibility for crime control to ordinary citizens.” How would that even work? Also claim the racial gap is due to differences in parenting… oh boy.
    
12. Child-rearing -> unclear how we make parents better stewards of their children.
