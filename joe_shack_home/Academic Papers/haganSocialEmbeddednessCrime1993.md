## Abstract

A missing piece in the literature that links crime and unemployment is an understanding of the proximate causes of joblessness in the lives of individuals. Granovetter has demonstrated with his concept of social embeddedness that early employment contacts can enhance the prospects of getting a job and subsequent occupational mobility. The alternative implication is that youths who are embedded in criminal contexts can become isolated from the likelihood of legitimate adult employment. This has important implications for an understanding of crime and unemployment, for while much of past macro-level research confirms that unemployment leads to crime in the aggregate, the reverse is likely true at the individual level among adolescents and young adults, especially in community settings with serious crime and unemployment problems. The implications of criminal embeddedness are explored in a well-known set of London panel data. Understanding the process of embeddedness is important because it helps to identify points of intervention, such as peer and justice system contacts.

## Notes

### Introduction

It has been typically assumed in the literature that unemployment causes crime (at the aggregate level). The idea being that unemployment and more generally concentrated disadvantage increase material need in neighborhoods making criminal activity more likely as non-criminal opportunities are less plentiful.

Ethnographic work suggests the causal direction is different at the individual-level, however. Typically, individuals become embedded in *criminal social networks* which is dependent upon their parents criminal behavior as well as their peers. Prolonged involvement in gangs leads to situations where individuals' future legitimate employment prospects are cut off. This is often done *invisibly* because these contacts just never develop (rather than having been established at some point and then being destroyed).

Hagan cites the influence of Granovetter a lot and how he did work exploring how employment is often found by leveraging one's personal network and being embedded in a context that enables one to find good jobs. Well, individuals who find themselves embedded in criminal contexts will find it harder to find gainful employment in the future because they got off to a bad start. Isolates individuals from conventional job markets and makes legitimate employment hard to obtain.

Their job history and skills (and lack of educational and legitimate credentials) along with official and unofficial stigmas associated with criminal justice and gang involvement make it hard to transition into legitimate work in adulthood. The *referrals* these youth receive are for criminal opportunities.

Having parents without many contacts in the legitimate world also makes it harder for their children to make it in the legitimate world since they cannot leverage the resources and contacts of their parents.

### Data

Longitudinal data on several hundred London male youth with many covariates available (individual IQ, teacher appraisals of behavior, parental unemployment history and criminal contact history, self-reported and official criminal contact at different ages, self-reported work history at appropriate ages, educational attainment, peer delinquency). Started in childhood and continued on into adulthood. These youth came from a relatively poor, working-class neighborhood.

### Results

* Use [[Poisson regression]], [[Logistic regression]], and [[OLS]] depending on the outcome (delinquency is count-based and modeled at ages 18 and 21, unemployment is binary and modeled at ages 18 and 21, use OLS for modeling unemployment at age 21, I think).
* Find that prior unemployment does not predict future criminal involvement but prior criminal involvement does predict future unemployment.
* In particular, they find a powerful interactive effect between adolescent criminal involvement and parental (father) involvement in crime. It is even more powerful than father's employment history.
* They also find delinquent peers (at ages 14 -1 5) and less educational attainment also lead to higher likelihood of unemployment at ages 21 - 22.
