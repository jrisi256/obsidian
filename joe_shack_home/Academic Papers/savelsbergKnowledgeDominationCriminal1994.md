## Abstract

Recent dramatic increases of criminal punishment in the United States and very different trends in the Federal Republic of Germany suggest a critique of basic sociological theory traditions. The article confronts structural-functionalist, Marxist, and legalistic approaches with these trends and suggests an alternative and more complex theory. Utilizing and ideal-typical comparison between the two countries, this article develops a set of interrelated hypotheses on the impact of the institutionalization of (a) knowledge production in the public, political, and academic sectors and (b) political and legal decision making on (c) macro outcomes of political and legal decision making. Using the case of criminal punishment, the article suggests new themes for theory development and empirical macro-sociological research. It also contributes to the understanding of current instabilities in the political process in the United States.

## My notes

### Introduction

- **Knowledge** -> cognitive and normative assumptions about the world. Knowledge, as defined here, is not based on particular methods of knowledge production. Knowledge includes beliefs based on diverse types of evidence consumed from a variety of sources.

- **Domination** -> Probability that a command with a given specific content will be obeyed by a given group of people.

- In the USA, **universalistic personalism** abounds. Public knowledge translates relatively easily into political and legal decision making -> decision making on minimum mandatory sentences, guilty verdicts, or sentences, for example. Means politicians and judges and what not are much more immediately responsible to their constituency rather than a larger political party. More exposed to shifts in public knowledge (much more volatile) and political pressure -> leading to more unstable patterns in criminal justice knowledge.

- However in such places as Germany -> **universalistic bureaucracy** abounds, bureaucratic rationales of political party machines or the political administration are more likely than public knowledge to influence political and legal decision making. More independent from public opinion -> rely upon bureaucratic knowledge which is much more stable.

### Background

- Explanations and predictions of criminal punishment have long been embedded in general sociological theories, of both functionalist and Marxist lineage. They've been used to explain why certain behaviors are punished, the purpose of punishment, the types of punishment applied, and the procedures on which punishment decisions are based. see Foucault, Weber, and Durkheim.
	- In particular Durkheim assumes a direct relation between social structure and law/punishment -> society will shift over time from criminal to compensatory law and intensity of punishment will decline -> empirical deficiencies in the theory.

- Marxists argue punishment reflects the needs of the labor market. Correlations between economic cycles and cycles of punishment, between imprisonment rates and unemployment rates.

- The legalistic school argues criminal punishment reflects the amount/severity of crime. Ups and down in punishment are the result of varying rates of crime.
 
- USA vs. Germany -> wildly diverging trends in imprisonment and punishment trends. The punishment rate drastically increased for the USA starting in the mid-1970s (becoming number one in the world) while for Germany it remained stable and flat. Even stranger, crime rates appeared to increase greatly for Germany and subsequently decline however the incarceration rate did not really respond in tandem and even declined. Meanwhile the crime rate increased only modestly in the USA while the incarceration rate dramatically increased -> crime and criminal punishment seem to be developing independently of each other.

- These observations cause problems for structural-functionalists (Durkheim) and Marxists -> both theories assume universal models of development which cannot account for the country-specific differences. Contradicts previous correlations between unemployment and incarceration -> the increase in imprisonment occurred despite a relatively stable labor market. A caveat -> the size of extremely poor *imprisonable* American populations has grown considerably. Much smaller and more stable in Germany -> vocational system and highly developed welfare system -> however these increases in extreme poverty are concentrated in a few northern cities while incarceration rates have increased steeply in most states.

- Specifically the problem -> These theories don't take the particular institutions of specific nation-states seriously nor do they incorporate the complex processes of knowledge or ideology construction.

**Axiom 1**: Every society institutionalizes knowledge production in their own way. This leads to society-specific _knowledge dynamics_ within different sectors of society AND distinct patterns of knowledge diffusion within these different sectors.

**Axiom 2**: Changes in knowledge development influence changes in political and legal decision making.

**Axiom 3**: How knowledge affects legal and political decision making depends on the country-specific mode of domination and how bureaucratized the political and legal institutions are.

**Axiom 4**: The substantive direction that change takes is a function of fundamental conflicts within social structures and between societal groups.

### Knowledge and Law

- Knowledge concerning crime and punishment is held and developed in a variety of societal sectors -> public, media, lawyers, politicians, researchers. Consists of contradictory assumptions (e.g. nature of offenders and causes of crime). Furthermore there are diverse knowledge beliefs about the functioning and justification of different punishment strategies. And again diverse opinions on the different modes of decision making (determinate vs. indeterminate sentencing).

- These beliefs intersect with your other beliefs and flow as logical extensions of them (conservative vs. leftist vs. liberal, view of man, etc.) Furthermore these belief systems are, at least, loosely tied to societal conditions.

- Thus in Germany -> idea of offenders as victims of society continued to be influential in many sectors of society. Meanwhile in the USA, the idea of the offender as a rational actor or biologically or psychologically troubled held more power -> general deterrence, retribution, (selective incapacitation), determinate sentencing. Why this change in beliefs? Hard to say. Questionably the crime wave of the 1960s caused this (although it's possible). Furthermore crime-related attitudes developed in tandem with growing neoconservative/neoliberal movement and a move toward more formal rationality and neoclassicism

- Others argue for the new criminal justice philosophies emerging as an expression of increasing resistance to the civil rights movements and intensifying racial conflicts of the 1960s.
    
* **Knowledge Construction**: The US and Germany have different institutionalizations of knowledge production. Germany has a more orderly organization and structure to their society when it comes to implementing policy. Interest groups are better organized, more well-defined, and have a more integrated and involved role in policy making. Less competition. Also the news media in Germany is largely publicly organized. Also public opinion is less steadily monitored and has less self-enforcing power. Strong institutionalized concerns about welfare.

* Evidence that punitive attitudes have changed much more dramatically in the USA vs. Germany. #disagree -> Given the somewhat contradictory views the American populace holds on punishment when asked in public opinion surveys.

### Hypotheses

1. The greater the involvement of neo-corporate (compulsory membership, monopoly over an issue, highly structured and organized) organizations in the production of public knowledge, the more stable that knowledge will remain over time.
   
2. The less frequently the public is monitored by opinion polls, the more stable public opinion remains and the more limited the impact of public opinion will be on the development of knowledge in other sectors of society.
   
3. The more intensely mass media-television, radio, newspapers, and so on-are controlled by public neo-corporate organizations (as opposed to market forces) the more stable is the knowledge those media present to the public.
   
4. The more that public knowledge is created by actors under the control of neocorporate welfare organizations, the more consistently that knowledge is characterized by welfare rationales.
   
5. The more the legislative branch of government is characterized by personalistic universalism, the more likely it is that changes in public knowledge will influence changes in political knowledge.
   
6. The more available the executive branch is to other sectors of society through the exchange of personnel, the more likely it is that changes in other sectors will influence changes in political knowledge.
   
7. The more the judicial branch is characterized by personalistic universalism, the stronger the impact of changes in public knowledge will be on legal knowledge.
   
8. To the degree that academia is rooted in the tradition of pragmatism, political-administrative knowledge will influence academic knowledge.
   
9. The more competitive the academic sector and the more dependent it is on funding and recognition from political-administrative agencies, the more it will be influenced by political knowledge.
   
10. The more academic departments are organized along the substantive lines of administrative agencies, the more academic knowledge will trail behind political knowledge.
    
11. The more the legal profession and the law are rooted in the idea of individual rights (as opposed to state intervention) the more likely it is that intervention phases will be reacted to by formal-rational movements in legal scholarship.
    
12. If political knowledge shifts with public opinion, then the same amount of change in public knowledge leads to more dramatic shifts in the macro outcome of political and legal decision making -> in this case, in incarceration rates.
    
13. If the public is directly involved in criminal justice decision making, then changes in public knowledge translate more directly into changes in criminal justice decision making.
    
14. If legal decision makers have more discretion, then they are more likely to respond to changing public knowledge, and they are more likely to respond in systems where such responsiveness furthers their political opportunities.

15. The joint effect of the greater dynamics in knowledge production and in legal and political decision making is multiplicative.

### Academia

USA academia comes from a tradition rooted in pragmatism and is thus responsive to issues in the political-administrative sector (plus are funded through political agencies) -> more likely to deal with individual rather than institutional factors. German academics are also more autonomous and less subjected to competitive pressures (wages, reputations, and such are much more egalitarian). "... adaptation of academic knowledge to that of powerful groups is stronger when intellectuals are less independent."

However it isn't as if knowledge in the political sector or legal profession gets translated into rates of punishment automatically. Judges and prosecutors and lawmakers must depend on satisfying the public sentiment and not deviating too much. #question Jeff raises an interesting point though about how isn’t it the case that these policy makers shape public opinion themselves?

### Conclusions

Empirical research needs to be done to verify these hypotheses.

But basically the pattern → US became very punitive in public opinion and in practice, leaders ignored structural causes of crime, the increase in criminal behavior in the 1960s and 1970s is not enough to explain these changes, changes in knowledge and ideology are necessary for understanding what happened → possible many things caused the shift e.g. successful civil rights movement, liberal Supreme Court, failures and disparities in the technocratic/substantive law prompting a neoclassical reaction also fueled by civil rights movement and racial riots, Black Americans moved to the Democrats and white blue-collar workers moved to the Republicans → increase in crime may have supported these movements for a time, they cannot explain them. However these 5 factors alone do not sufficiently explain the extreme USA dynamics → purely structural approaches are insufficient → nation-specific practices of knowledge and domination must be accounted for → how knowledge is spread and diffused between sectors → mutually reinforcing politicians and the public.
