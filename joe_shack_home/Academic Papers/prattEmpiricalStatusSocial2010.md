## Abstract

Social learning theory has remained one of the core criminological paradigms over the last four decades. Although a large body of scholarship has emerged testing various propositions specified by the theory, the empirical status of the theory in its entirety is still unknown. Accordingly, in the present study, we subject this body of empirical literature to a [[meta‐analysis]] to assess its empirical status. Results reveal considerable variation in the magnitude and stability of effect sizes for variables specified by social learning theory across different methodological specifications. In particular, relationships of crime/deviance to measures of differential association and definitions (or antisocial attitudes) are quite strong, yet those for differential reinforcement and modeling/imitation are modest at best. Furthermore, effect sizes for differential association, definitions, and differential reinforcement all differed significantly according to variations in model specification and research designs across studies. The implications for the continued vitality of social learning in criminology are discussed.

## My notes

* The relationship between crime and measures of differential association and definitions are strong.
* The relationship between differential reinforcement and modeling/imitations are modest, at best.
* Effect sizes different according to variations in the model specification and research designs.

### Background

* It is hard for us as a discipline to discard theories. Lots of non-scientific reasons why this may happen. However, even scientifically, we have problems. Theories are are stated discursively rather than as a series of formal, testable propositions. Datasets do not always contain measures which allow for complete tests of a theory.
  
* Advances in the way meta-analyses are done. Typically, they had been done using  [[narrative reviews]]. The reviewer(s) read a large number of studies and concludes how supportive or not they are of the theory in question.
	* Mitigates concerns of investigator bias.
	* More clear and transparent criteria of how a study got included in the review (although it seems like narrative studies could include this).
	* More systematic way of dealing with a large body of information.
	* Can provide precise point estimates making comparison across studies easier.
  
* Narrative studies, the few prior true meta-analyses and evaluation research on programs designed to change offender attitudes (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) all argue differential association and social learning are important.
  
* There is always the problem of "garbage in, garbage out". There is also the issue of [[publication bias]]. They deal with it, somewhat unsatisfactorily on page 772 or page 9 of the PDF in footnote 2.

### Methods

* **Differential association**: These variables are related to the behaviors and attitudes of an individual's social network.
	* Peers' behaviors and peer attitudes.
	* Parents' behaviors and parental attitudes.
	* Others' behaviors and others' attitudes.
* **Definitions**: Represent an individual's antisocial or criminal beliefs/attitudes.
* **Differential reinforcement**
	* Peer reactions.
	* Parental reactions.
	* Others' reactions.
	* Rewards and costs.
* **Modeling and Imitation**: Number of admired models.
* **Moderators** -> wide variety.
* **Sample characteristics**:
	* Sampling frame.
	* Gender composition.
	* Racial composition.
	* Age composition.
* **Model specification and research design**:
	* What variables do you control for? What other theories do you test against?
	* Cross-sectional or longitudinal?
	* What was the dependent variable of interest?

Use a [[Multilevel modeling|multilevel modeling]] where individual effect sizes are specified as the level 1 variable and the studies are treated as level 2 variables.

### Results

* * **Differential association**: Find peer behaviors are stronger influence followed by others and then parents. Attitudes of peers, and parents, and others were much smaller.
* **Definitions**: Strong effect sizes.
* **Differential reinforcement**: Moderate to weak effect sizes.
* **Modeling and Imitation**: Moderate effect sizes.
* **Moderators** and **sample characteristics**: Results generalized across a wide variety of sampling frames and sample compositions. The most consistent moderator was age (with some moderation for gender and sampling frame i.e., general sample vs. school sample).
* **Model specification and research design**: Results are generally robust to control specifications, time dimension, and dependent variable choices.
	* "... the dependent variable used across studies is important for measures of peers' behavior, where the effects are strongest in studies that assess drug and alcohol abuse and weakest in studies predicting violent crime, property crime, and theft." (pg. 787 or 24 of the PDF). #highlight
