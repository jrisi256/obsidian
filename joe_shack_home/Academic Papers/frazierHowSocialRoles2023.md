## Abstract

This study draws on role theory and the [[Life course theory|life-course]] perspective to examine how sleep health (duration, quality, and latency) is shaped by social role accumulation (number of roles), role repertoires (role combinations), and role contexts among middle-aged adults. We also examine how the relationships between social roles and sleep health are gendered. We use data from the [[National Longitudinal Survey of Youth]] 1979 Cohort (N = 7,628). Results show that role accumulation is associated with less sleep and decreased insomnia symptoms, and that role repertoires also impact sleep (e.g., parenthood leads to diminished sleep quantity and quality). There is also evidence that contextual factors related to employment history, marital quality, and parenthood affect sleep health. Furthermore, results reveal that several of the relationships between social roles and sleep are gendered. Taken together, findings demonstrate the utility of examining links between multiple dimensions of social roles and sleep health.

## My notes

### Research question

* [[Role theory]] -> social roles (e.g., being employed, being married, being a parent) link individuals to social and material resources and integrate them into society. More integrated individuals with more roles are more likely to follow healthy norms. [[Role enhancement]] -> increased social support, access to financial resources, and a greater sense of meaning.
  
* On the other hand, being unable to fulfill role obligations and expectations can cause stress which leads to health problems. [[Role strain hypothesis]] -> too many roles or roles which compete for a person's finite time and resources.
  
* [[Role contexts]] -> combinations of roles speak to the interactive effect social roles can have. Employment or marriage tend to be considered beneficial due to increased access to resources and social networks, but together they can be quite stressful.
  
* Roles can also take on different meaning depending on where someone is in their life course. This paper focuses on midlife -> peak work position, family leadership, self-confidence, managing stress but also the highest combination of stress and demands and role conflicts.
  
* Sleep is linked to the social world, and it is shaped by the roles people play and are structured by their gender. E.g., women may be more at risk for poor sleep due to societal expectations around their parenting obligations.
  
* **Research Question 1** -> How is sleep health in midlife related to role accumulation, role repertoires, and role contexts?
* **Research Question 2** -> To what extent are the relationships between various dimensions of social roles and sleep health gendered?

### Data and Methods

* National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979.
  
* **Dependent variables** -> sleep quantity, sleep quality, and sleep latency (how long does it take you to fall asleep?).
  
* **Independent variables** -> Role accumulation, role repertoires, and role contexts.
	* Categorical variables for marriage, employed, parents.
	* Role accumulation -> Total number of roles.
	* Created categories for the cross of all 3 categories (role repertoire).
	* Social role contextual factors:
		* Employment -> job satisfaction, number of hours worked each week, working more than one job.
		* Marriage contextual factors -> number of marriages, number of years married, age of first marriage. Second set of measures only available for females (extent of positive communication, frequency of arguing, marital happiness).
		* Parenthood -> number of children in the home, frequency of seeing children not living in the home, age of children in the home.
	* Gender, race/ethnicity, age, education (less than high school, high school, one or more years of college), income, and self-assessed health.
	  
* Use [[OLS]] and [[Poisson regression]].

### Results

* More roles is associated with less sleep during the week, more sleep on the weekend, and less insomnia symptoms. **More social roles is predictive of more sleep latency for women while it is predictive of less sleep latency for men**.
  
* Parenthood is associated with worse sleep outcomes. Among certain slices, a gendered effect appears. Employed, single fathers do not have fewer hours of sleep on the weekend while women do. **Meanwhile, unemployment married fathers are more likely to exhibit insomnia symptoms than women**.
  
	* **Interpretation** -> Less integrated adults (married only or parents only) experienced shorter sleep durations during the weekend and increased insomnia symptoms compared to the most integrated group (employed, married parents).
	  
* Being employed and married was the best role combination for sleep.
  
* Any role repertoire which involved parenting (especially single parenting) were generally associated with poor sleep health.
  
* Greater work satisfaction was associated with fewer insomnia symptoms.

* Marital quality (only asked for women) was associated with healthier sleep.
  
* Self-assessed sleep habits may not be the most accurate but no evidence that such bias varies systematically across gender or social role.
