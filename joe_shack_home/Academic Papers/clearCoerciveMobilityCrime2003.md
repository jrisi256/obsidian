## Abstract

This article explores how incarceration affects crime rates at the neighborhood level. Incarceration is analyzed as a form of residential mobility that may damage local network structures and undermine informal control. Geocoded data are combined with census data, data on incarceration convictions and releases, and crime data for Tallahassee, Florida. The results show a positive relationship between the rate of releases one year and the community's crime rates the following year. They also show that low rates of admissions to prison have an uncertain impact on crime rates, moderate rates reduce crime, and higher rates increase crime. Implications for criminal justice policies are discussed.

## My Notes

#paper_idea -> Can we improve upon this paper? Need better data and methods. #data_issue #methods_issue 
### Research Question

* How does the incarceration rate at the community or neighborhood level affect future crime rates in that neighborhood? It is hypothesized that incarceration is a form of forced residential mobility which damages local network structures and undermines informal social control mechanisms.
	* Incarceration as a tipping point -> past a certain point, more incarceration becomes harmful.
  
* Previous research has argued that high rates of incarceration contribute to [[Social disorganization|social disorganization]].
	* Social disorganization might be a theory of formal and informal social control since disorganization contributes to a community's lack of ability to access formal social control mechanisms and formal social control mechanisms can positively or negatively impact a community's informal social control.
	* Social disorganization as ignored the effects of public policy on community life. #paper_idea 

* Focus on residential mobility (incarceration is a forced version):
	* Neighbors are isolated from one another and cannot engage in [[Collective efficacy|collective efficacy]].
	* Lots of new residents leads to low social integration and high anonymity impeding cohesion.
	* Reduces the sense of commitment in the neighborhood.
	* **Incarceration can fit into this conceptualization** -> it harms the people left behind:
		* Less supervision of youth.
		* Financial burden of phone calls and visits of the inmates and supporting them when they return (and loss of income when they leave).
		* Stigma of incarceration harms familial reputation.
		* Increases [[Legal cynicism|legal cynicism]].
	* On the other hand maybe it can be helpful:
		* Reduce fear of crime which leads to isolation and anonymity.
	* Tipping point idea.

### Data and Methods

* Neighborhood-level study conducted in Tallahassee, Florida (Leon County).
* Prison admissions, prison releases, police-reported crime, and census data.
* Intensive procedure to delineate neighborhoods.
	* 80 neighborhoods with populations ranging from 249 to 4,538.

**Dependent variable** -> police reported crime in 1997.

**Independent variable**:
* **Coercive mobility** (measured separately as admissions and releases from prison in 1996). Include linear, square, and cubed terms.
* **Social disorganization**: [[Concentrated disadvantage]].
* **Voluntary residential mobility**: Percentage of residents older than 5 who did not live in the same house as they did in 1985.

Do some outlier analysis since they have a small sample. Report results with and without outliers. They use [[Cook's Distance]].

Use [[negative binomial regression]].

### Results

**Table 1**:
* Releases are not significantly related to crime.
* Admissions are not linearly related.
* Admissions has a significant negative squared relationship and a positive cubic relationship to crime.

**Results are stronger when outlier observations are dropped.**

**Figure 2**:
* At low levels of incarceration, there is a positive relationship between incarceration rates and crime.
* At moderate to moderate-high levels of incarceration, there is a negative relationship that diminishes over time.
* At high levels of incarceration, the relationship becomes positive.
* The overall trend is a negative one, though, with the slope of the relationship gradually being pulled closer to 0 and eventually positive.

### Limitations and Conclusions

* Data limitations make it impossible to use [[Structural equation modeling]] or some form of [[instrumental variable]] or [[two stage least-squares regression]].

* "It is not consistent with the proposed theory to model incarceration as a mediating factor between the ecological variables (poverty, mobility, ethnic heterogeneity) and crime." #highlight #question #quote #theory_challenge #disagree #paper_idea 

* Finds some support for [[Routine activity]] theory because in some models, the release of offenders into a community could potentially be increasing the supply of motivated offenders.
