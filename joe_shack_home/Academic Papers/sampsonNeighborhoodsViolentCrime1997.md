## Abstract

It is hypothesized that collective efficacy, defined as social cohesion among neighbors combined with their willingness to intervene on behalf of the common good, is linked to reduced violence. This hypothesis was tested on a 1995 [[survey]] of 8782 residents of 343 neighborhoods in [[Chicago]], Illinois. [[Multilevel modeling]] analyses showed that a measure of [[collective efficacy]] yields a high between-[[neighborhood]] reliability and is negatively associated with variations in violence, when individual-level characteristics, [[measurement error]], and prior violence are controlled. Associations of [[concentrated disadvantage]] and [[residential instability]] with [[violence]] are largely mediated by collective efficacy.

## My notes

* **Collective efficacy** -> Social cohesion among neighbors combined with their willingness to intervene on behalf of the common good is linked to reduced violence.
* **High-level results**
	* Analyses reveal the survey measure of collective efficacy is negatively correlated with violence when individual-level characteristics, measurement error, and prior violence are controlled.
	* It would appear that correlations of concentrated disadvantage and residential instability with violence are mediated by collective efficacy.
* **Question**
	* Violence has long been associated with low socioeconomic status and residential instability of neighborhoods. Leads to geographical concentration of violence which is then connected to neighborhood composition. But why does concentrated poverty lead to violence?
	* Propose the mediating variable cannot be found in demographics. It will be found in collective efficacy. The focus here is on **informal mechanisms** of control (supervising play groups of children, willingness to intervene with truant teenagers) rather on **formal mechanisms** (police, courts). Linked to the ability of the community to come together in the face of cuts to resources but also to extract more resources.
	* Collective efficacy will flourish in those neighborhoods that are most socially cohesive, where neighbors trust one another. Just as individuals vary in how effective they are at performing various tasks so, too, will neighborhoods.
* **Collective efficacy**
	* What influences collective efficacy? Residential tenure, home ownership, and segregation. Social ties take time to form. Economic stratification by race fuels social isolation of lower-income, minority, and single-parent residents and neighborhood concentration of disadvantage. Even if personal ties are strong in an area, they may be weakly tethered to collective action.
* **Research questions**
	* Does concentrated disadvantage decrease collective efficacy? Does residential stability increase collective efficacy?
	* Does collective efficacy mediate the effects of neighborhood disadvantage and residential instability on violence?
* **Methods**
	* Informal [[Social control theory|social control]] was measured by a [[Likert scale]]. Count on neighbors to intervene if children were skipping school, committing acts of graffiti, showing disrespect to an adult, and other questions.
	* [[Social cohesion]] and trust were measured on a similar scale with questions like “people around here are willing to help out their neighbors”, “this is a close knit neighborhood”, etc. They’re correlated! Combine the two into “collective efficacy”.
	* [[Violence]] was measured by 1) asking respondents how often a variety of violent actions occurred in the past 6 months. Then 2) assessed personal victimization by asking if they were a victim of violence. 3) Finally used the reported rate of homicide.
	* Used the Census for various socioeconomic indicators and home ownership rates and immigration rates.
* **Results**
	* **Collective Efficacy**
		* High SES, home ownership, and age were associated with elevated levels of collective efficacy. High mobility was negatively associated.
		* At the neighborhood level, concentrated disadvantage and immigrant concentration were significantly, negatively associated with collective efficacy. Residential stability was significantly positively associated with collective efficacy.
	* **Violence**
		* Concentrated disadvantaged neighborhoods experience higher rates of violence.
		* Less residential stability generally meant more violence.
		* Immigrant concentration was also positively correlated with violence.
		* Residential stability and immigrant concentration were not correlated with homicides (strangely higher residential stability meant higher homicide rates).
		* When collective efficacy is added to the model, it becomes the most important variable. Less collective efficacy means more violence. Collective efficacy appeared to partially mediate the relationship between neighborhood social composition and violence.
		* Tested other related, correlated social processes to see if they would have more explanatory power: neighborhood services, friendship/kinship ties, and organizational participation. Collective efficacy seemed to be consistently the most important. Suggests these other social processes are not enough to reduce violence.
* **Limitations**
	* Study isn’t causal.
	* Indicators of informal control are inferred.
	* Other factors not measured in the survey may be at play.
