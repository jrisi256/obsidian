## Abstract

This paper presents a [[anomie|general strain theory]] of crime and delinquency that is capable of overcoming the criticisms of previous strain theories. In the first section, strain theory is distinguished from [[Social control theory|social control]] and [[differential association]] theory. In the second section, the three major types of strain are described: (1) strain as the actual or anticipated failure to achieve positively valued goals, (2) strain as the actual or anticipated removal of positively valued stimuli, and (3) strain as the actual or anticipated presentation of negatively valued stimuli. In the third section, guidelines for the measurement of strain are presented. And in the fourth section, the major adaptations to strain are described, and those factors influencing the choice of delinquent versus non-delinquent adaptations are discussed.

## My notes

### Introduction

* Argues that strain theory needs to evolve from the early ideas of Merton ([[mertonSocialStructureAnomie1938]]), Cloward [[clowardIllegitimateMeansAnomie1959]] and Ohlin.
* The theory is written at the social-psychological level and as such focuses on the individual and their immediate social environment.
* The theory is written for the empirical researcher in mind with guidelines for testing.
* The focus is on adolescents because that is where the best data is available for testing the theory.

### Differences from social control and differential association

1. Specifies different types of social relationships that lead to delinquency.
	1. Focuses on negative relationships in which an individual is not treated how they want.
	2. **Social control theory** is focused on the absence (or presence) of relationships with conventional persons and institutions.
	3. **Differential association** is associated with the push and pull of positive and negative messaging which come about from interactions with others.
2. Specifies different motivations for delinquency.
	1. Adolescents are pressured into delinquency by negative emotions which often result from negative relationships. These negative emotions may lead them to:
		1. Make use of illegitimate channels to achieve their goals.
		2. Attack or escape the perceived source of adversity.
		3. Manage their negative emotions through drugs.
	2. **Social control theory** denies outside forces pressure adolescents into delinquency. The absence of relationships to conventional institutions frees adolescents to commit crime. Abuse would lead to an attenuation of the social control systems.
	3. **Differential association** argues adolescents commit crime as they learn its acceptable usage in specific circumstances. Abuse would lead someone to not hold views favorable to criminality (potentially).

### Major types of strain

Each type of strain refers to a different type of negative relationship with others. E..g, a teacher insults you and this could 1) violate your sense of fair outcomes, 2) result in the taking away of some positive stimuli, 3) lead to the presentation of negative stimuli which in this case is the insult itself.

1. Other individuals may prevent one from achieving positively valued goals.
	1. Disjuncture between aspirations and expectations.
		1. Typically seen in the Merton formulations. The theory cannot explain:
			1. extensive nature of middle-class delinquency.
			2. neglect goals other than monetary success.
			3. neglect barriers to achievement other than social class.
			4. do not fully specify why some individuals (and others do not) turn to crime.
			5. Even with all these criticisms, the most basic formulation of the theory has limited empirical support.
	2. Disjuncture between expectations and actual achievements.
	3. Disjuncture between perceived hypothetically fair outcomes and actual outcomes.
		1. Allows for variation in the goals and outcomes one expects. We just have to identify if individuals think they are achieved fairly.
2. Other individuals may remove threaten or remove positively valued stimuli one possesses.
3. Other individuals may threaten or present negatively valued stimuli.

### Outcomes of strain

* Each type of strain felt increases the likelihood of an individual experiencing one or more negative emotions with anger being the most critical.
	* Increases the level of felt or actual injury.
	* Creates a desire for revenge to make things right.
	* Energizes the individual for action.
* Strain is accumulated -> It is not the unique properties of one event but the accumulation of strain (especially in a short window of time) that lead one to want to commit crime.

### Measuring strain

* Researchers should employ composite indices of strain. Draw upon inventories of stressful life events while recognizing they may not be seen as universally stressful.
* Adverse events are more influential to the extent they are:
	* greater in magnitude or size.
	* recent.
	* of a long duration.
	* clustered in time.

### Adaptations to strain

* Only some strained individuals turn to crime and delinquency. Why? Individual-level characteristics.
	* **Cognitive coping strategies** -> Ignore/minimize the negative outcomes and boost the valence of positive outcomes. Accept responsibility for adversity. These all can be positive or negative (e.g., you delude yourself into thinking things are fine).
	* **Behavioral coping strategies** -> Change your behaviors which you think will lead you away from the perceived negative outcome. Alternatively take revenge.
	* **Emotional coping strategies** -> Focus on alleviating the negative emotional state rather than trying to cognitively reinterpret the situation or alter the behaviors which led to those emotions. This can be also be done in a positive or negative way.
* So then why do some individuals adapt in a deviant way to strain?
	* Constraints to non-delinquent and delinquent coping.
		* How initially important were the blocked goals to you? How many other avenues are available for you to achieve those goals?
		* Individual ability to cope.
		* Conventional social support.
		* Costs vs. benefits of engaging in crime.
		* Macro-level variables
			* influence the identification of worthy goals.
			* influences one's sensitivity to stress and what one views as stressful.
			* Certain environments just make it harder to employ legitimate cognitive, behavioral, and emotional coping strategies.
	* Disposition to engage in non-delinquent vs. delinquent coping.
		* One's temperament.
		* Prior learning history.
		* One's belief and values.
		* One's beliefs about the causes of one's adversity.
		* Association with delinquent peers? #da_social-learning_theory 

### Concluding remarks

* GST is not a true alternative to other theories. It is meant to complement other theories and flesh them out.
* Core hypotheses:
	* Adverse relations with other will be positively associated with measures of delinquency with social control and differential association held constant.
	* Adverse relations will have a cumulative impact on delinquency past a certain threshold (potentially interactive rather than additive).
	* The impact of strain will be conditioned on several variables as mentioned above.
