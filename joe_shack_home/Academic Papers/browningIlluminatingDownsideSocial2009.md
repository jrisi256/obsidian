## Abstract

The potential “downside” of [[social capital]] has received relatively limited attention in research to date. In this article, the author presents a theoretical approach to urban crime and criminogenic conditions that emphasizes the potential for competition between two types of social capital, [[social network]]—based reciprocated exchange and [[Collective efficacy]], in the regulation of neighborhood crime. This “[[Negotiated coexistence]]” approach hypothesizes that as network interaction and reciprocated exchange among neighborhood residents increase, offenders and conventional residents become increasingly interdependent. In turn, the social capital provided by network integration of offenders may diminish the regulatory effectiveness of collective efficacy. Using data from the 1990 Census and the 1994-1995 Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods Community Survey, the author tests the negotiated-coexistence model against competing expectations regarding the association between networks, collective efficacy, and crime. Consistent with the negotiated-coexistence approach, [[ordinary least squares]] and [[spatial regression]] models of property crime and social disorder indicate that the regulatory effects of collective efficacy on crime are reduced in neighborhoods characterized by high levels of network interaction and reciprocated exchange.

### Introduction

* #quote 
* Not all forms of social capital are conducive to the inhibition of crime. Interactions and reciprocated exchanges between neighborhood residents makes them more interdependent and less able to practice collective efficacy to deter crime. I.e., Offenders become integrated into the neighborhood. The Wire is a great show to demonstrate this. They were pillars in the community.

### Theory testing

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SYNIL69M?page=1561&annotation=BQ4JSARU) “Beginning with the systemic approach, I test the expectation that social interaction and reciprocated exchange will exert a monotonic, unconditional regulatory effect on property crime and disorder. I then consider the hypothesis that the effect of interaction and exchange is dependent on the level of informal social control within the community (as measured by collective efficacy). Specifically, I test the cultural transmission model’s expectation that the effect of social interaction on crime is positive (facilitative) in neighborhoods with lower levels of informal social control. Finally, I test the negotiated-coexistence model, considering the hypothesis that increasingly prevalent social interaction and exchange reduce the protective effect of informal social control. As articulated, the negotiated-coexistence model offers an explanation for the counterintuitive existence of neighborhoods with relatively high levels of social integration and crime.” ([Browning, 2009, p. 1561](zotero://select/library/items/PSX97VWY)) Test three theoretical approaches.
	* Test the idea that social interaction and reciprocated exchange exert a regulatory effect on property crime. From the [[systemic model]] and [[cultural transmission]] which argues there is a positive relationship between between the strength and extent of network ties within communities and the effective informal social control of crime.
	* The effect social interactions and exchanges have on crime is dependent on collective efficacy (informal social control).
	* Increasingly prevalent social interaction and exchange reduce the protective effect of informal social control. This can help us understand why some communities have high levels of crime but also social integration.

### Methods

	* While you have lived in this neighborhood, has your home ever been broken into? Have you had something stolen on your property but outside your home?
* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SYNIL69M?page=1563&annotation=NDY7VAHM) “Collective efficacy is operationalized through combining measures of social capital as represented by solidarity and mutual trust and shared expectations for informal social-control efforts (Sampson et al., 1997). The [[Social Cohesion scale]] is constructed from a cluster of conceptually related items from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods Community Survey ([[PHDCN-CS]]) measuring the respondent’s level of agreement with the following statements:” ([Browning, 2009, p. 1563](zotero://select/library/items/PSX97VWY))
	* Use survey items asking about Social Cohesion and Informal Social Control. E.g., "People around here are willing to help their neighbors. This is a close-knit neighborhood. Etc."

### Main Findings

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SYNIL69M?page=1566&annotation=WH2EIWXA) Unit increases in networked interaction/reciprocated exchange lead to increases in they survey responses for having experienced property crime.
	* Goes against the systemic model and more in line with views from negotiated coexistence.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SYNIL69M?page=1567&annotation=MGRH2Y5R) However unit increases in networked interaction/reciprocated exchange are not significantly associated with a resident ever experienced property crime in the past 6 months. Interestingly. Need to see the results section.
* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SYNIL69M?page=1566&annotation=KE3H5Y2Z) Collective efficacy has its predicted negative association with crime.
* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SYNIL69M?page=1567&annotation=THX3R4GM) The interaction of network density and collective efficacy is significant. This is what I think is important.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SYNIL69M?page=1569&annotation=UCCCGUZV) “The interaction effect indicates that as neighborhood network interaction and exchange increases, the regulatory effect of collective efficacy declines. Specifically, at 1.5 standard deviations below the mean on the network interaction and exchange scale, a standard deviation increase in collective efficacy leads to a 0.4 standard deviation reduction in the property crime scale. At 1.5 standard deviations above the mean on the network interaction and exchange scale, the magnitude of the collective efficacy is virtually zero. Thus at high levels of network interaction, collective efficacy is no longer negatively associated with property crime during the respondent’s residence in the neighborhood.” ([Browning, 2009, p. 1569](zotero://select/library/items/PSX97VWY)) Very strong support for the negotiated coexistence theory/model.
* "Thus combining OLS analyses presented in Tables 2 and 3 suggests that the relatively powerful regulatory effects of collective efficacy on property crime at average and low levels of network interaction and exchange are essentially wiped out when network interaction and exchange reaches high levels." (pg. 1570, pg. 15 of the PDF) #quote
* "Collective efficacy is most powerfully associated with crime... when the level of network interaction and reciprocated exchange is low. Increasing sociability and exchange at the neighborhood level, however, attenuates the impact of collective efficacy on crime." (pg. 1571, pg. 16 of the PDF)
* Negotiated co-existence may facilitate the development of weak ties which are more effective for the implementation of informal social-control norms without generating extensive bonding networks which weaken the inclination to sanction offenders.
