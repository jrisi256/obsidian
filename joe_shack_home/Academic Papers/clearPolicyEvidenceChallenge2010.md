## My notes

#causal_inference_skeptical 
#paper_idea  -> read all the papers he cites about what we know works in Criminology to generate ideas for incarceration project as well as to begin the literature review. #papers_to_read 

### Introduction

* Excitement that criminal justice policy may finally be responsive to evidence and research.

* However, there is some cause for concern according to the author.

### What counts as evidence?

* [[experiment|RCTs]] are seen as the gold standard. So let's start there.
  
	* Generalization concerns -> You need a body of evidence to accumulate before you can talk about the efficacy of a policy. This can cause concerns when a few studies have less-than-inspiring outcomes.
	  
	* Policy research has a well-documented consistency problem -> it is hard to demonstrate consistently that a particular program or policy is effective.
	  
	* It is also hard to produce enough high-quality RCTs to produce this evidence in the first place.
	  
	* This work is *incredibly conservative*. It relies on the existence of a collection of efficacy studies pertaining to some program or policy that has already happened and for those studies to show a clear and consistent pattern. We can only ever evaluate what has already happened.

	* But we also want to establish an evidence base for what will work or what might work. To do this, we need to expand beyond RCTs and consider case studies, quasi-experimental work, and qualitative work. A new problem emerges when we allow in this work -> we never seem to know something in a permanent or immutable way -> also problems of interpretation become even more problematic.

### Policy making in practice

Four main problems in the criminal justice system in the USA:

1. Mass incarceration
2. Reentry cycling
3. Ineffective programming
4. Skill deficits

* Differences in policy making evaluation vs. program administration evaluation.
* How can administrators obtain support for programs *that work* and how can they implement in effective ways?
	* There is a lot of scientific evidence on programs that do work on correctional programming.
	* No evidence on how administrators can get the necessary support to run these programs.
	* No evidence on how to actually run these programs effectively.

### Limitations of RCTs

* Most of what we *know* in Criminology and, in particular, mass incarceration has not come from RCTs. In fact, sometimes there is no RCT which could be run to determine the processes in play e.g., mass incarceration.
  
* It is hard to accurately say the effects of some policy e.g., mass incarceration caused a decline in crime. Some credible research says yes and other no -> cherry pick your evidence.
	* Regardless, no scientific study could conclusively prove that the reduction in crime was worth the other costs. We have no idea what the counterfactual could be -> mass incarceration caused crime to decrease by X amount compared to... what? and at what cost?
	  
* So then if we want to reduce prison populations by focusing on what works we would need to focus our efforts purely on prison programming... which has a very low ceiling.

* We have lots of *evidence* on how to get fewer people going to prison and have them stay in prison for a shorter period of time -> none of it is experimental, though.

### Development of new and big ideas

* Justice reinvestment policy -> an idea where reduced rates of incarceration would lead to a portion of the savings to be reinvested in those communities whose residents make the highest contribution to the incarceration rate. The author is explicit about how this is a great policy.
	* The evidence base includes no RCTs.
	* RCTs are, of course, important to guiding the implementation of the policy.
	  
* If we only take action on *what works* based solely on the evidence of RCTs, the conservatism will shackle us from taking bold actions. We need to think more broadly about evidence. It is true that by expanding our definition of evidence it will lead to more fights about the nature of that evidence -> the author argues this trade-off is necessary if we are to embrace bold, new ideas which are necessary to fix our current situation.

* For this to be effective, we need more *basic research* and understanding of crime. Hot spots policing was developed as a result of research into the spatial distribution of crime. Problem solving courts were developed as a means of addressing of the unmet needs of people processed through the justice system.

### Moving forward

#### What we must do

1. Size of the federal budget dedicated to basic research must grow.
2. The funding for program evaluations should be distinguished from funding for other types of research.
3. Funding of studies and dissemination of results should be based on scientific peer review.
4. Devise a regular and transparent process for advising the federal government on its crime and justice research priorities.

#### What we ought to do

1. Prepare amicus curiae briefs for the Supreme Court.
2. Provide regular topical briefings in the nation's capital.
3. Comment on and provide support for legislation.
	1. Raises issues about how the ASC can do this if many of its members object to the policy.

#### What we should do

1. Juvenile life sentences.
2. Racial profiling by the police.
3. Residential restrictions for people convicted of sex crimes.
4. Expunging criminal records.

We cannot stand idly by because policy is going to get made and our evidence will be used -> with or without us. Mistakes will be made, but it is preferable for us to be involved so as to mitigate as many mistakes in interpretation and implementation as possible. We, as scientists, will also make mistakes. But the state of our knowledge will always be imperfect. We can only act on what we think we know.
