## My notes

* Deviant delinquent subcultures are not completely oppositional to mainstream culture. Many delinquents feel guilty and do not feel like martyrs.
* Also, they are quick to anger if someone they admire is called delinquent
* Additionally, delinquents don’t equally victimize everybody. Certain social groups aren’t valid targets indicating some sense of understanding of the wrongness.
* Doubtful juvenile delinquents are totally immune for pressures of conformity from mainstream culture.
* Why do delinquents commit crimes? It is likely because rules are hardly ever absolute to begin with. E.g. don’t kill (except in self-defense or in war). Rules are flexible.
* “It is our argument that much delinquency is based on what is essentially an unrecognized extension of defenses of crimes, in the form of justifications for deviance that are seen as valid by the delinquent but not by the legal system or society at large.”
* Rationalizations which protect from self-shame after the fact but also are used before the fact to justify the action in the first place. Have your cake and eat it too as you participate in the dominant value system without breaking its rules yet you get the benefits from breaking the rules. Thus juveniles are not radically opposed but more apologetic failures.

### Example Neutralizations

* **Denial of Responsibility**: It was an accident! It wasn’t my fault! I was made to do it!
* **Denial of Injury**: Nobody got hurt so what’s the harm.
* **Denial of Victim**: The person whom I harmed had it coming!
* **Condemnation of condemners**: Y’all are a bunch of hypocrites!
* **Appeal to Higher Loyalties**: Don’t necessarily reject mainstream norms, but they hold the norms of their gang higher and thus must break mainstream norms to fulfill these higher-order norms. “I must always help my friends.”
