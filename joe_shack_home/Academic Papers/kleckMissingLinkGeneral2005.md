## Abstract

Research on the deterrent effects of punishment falls into two categories: macro-level studies of the impact of aggregate punishment levels on crime rates, and individual-level studies of the impact of perceived punishment levels on self-reported criminal behavior. For policy purposes, however, the missing link—ignored in previous research—is that between aggregate punishment levels and individual perceptions of punishment. This paper addresses whether higher actual punishment levels increase the perceived certainty, severity, or swiftness of punishment. Telephone interviews with 1,500 residents of fifty-four large urban counties were used to measure perceptions of punishment levels, which were then linked to actual punishment levels as measured in official statistics. Hierarchical linear model estimates of multivariate models generally found no detectable impact of actual punishment levels on perceptions of punishment. The findings raise serious questions about deterrence-based rationales for more punitive crime control policies.

## My notes

### What is the research question?

* No macro-level study of deterrence theory (assessing the relationship between aggregate crime rates and severity, celerity, and certainty of punishment) or micro-level (based on survey research) has been able to, at this point, demonstrate a link at the individual level that individuals' perceptions of actual punishment probabilities are accurate.
	* Increases or decreases in probability level may or may not lead to accurate updates (or updates at all) in individual perceptions of the level of punishment.
	  
* [[Deterrence theory]] argues that increases in punishment levels will cause individuals to update their beliefs about punishment levels and adjust behavior accordingly.
* [[Specific deterrence]] -> individuals who have been punished refrain from offending again in the future.
* [[General deterrence]] -> current levels of punishment dissuade people from committing crimes.
* [[Incapacitation effect]] -> It may be the case that severe punishments for crime, in cases where they reduce criminal behavior, operate totally through this mechanism.
  
* Deterrence can only operate to the degree that individuals perceive the risk of punishment correctly. "The greater the certainty, severity, and swiftness of punishment, the lower the crime rate will be." -> "The greater the **perceived** certainty, severity, and swiftness..."
  
* Many deterrence theorists argue that individuals vary in their susceptibility to deterrence (e.g., those with greater stakes in conformity are likely to be more affected by the threat of punishment).
	* No deterrence theorist argues, though, that individuals do not update their beliefs or their beliefs are inaccurate to a large degree (individuals beliefs about punishment levels are not correlated with actual punishment levels).
	* Why would beliefs be inaccurate? It's not like our economy which is saturated with information. There just is not simply as much, as accurate, and as well communicated information about the risks of punishment.
	* Some arguments for and against current and past criminals being better judges of objective levels of punishment (e.g., they have experience, but their experience might not be indicative of general trends).
	  
* Certainly people are deterred by punishment. However, if people's beliefs are not well aligned with reality, and they do not update in accordance with reality, increasing punishment levels in hopes that it will deter crime is a misplaced hope.
	* Also proposing that decreasing punishment levels will not lead to an increase in crime.
	  
* In general, deterrence theorists believe that punishment levels shape perceptions of punishment which go on to influence crime rates.
	* At the macro-level, punishment levels are explicitly measured and perceptions of punishment are unmeasured (or assumed). Thus, they cannot answer why higher level of punishments may or may not lead to decreases in crime.
	* At the micro-level, perceptions of punishment are measured while actual punishment levels go unmeasured -> These studies typically focus on the perceptual question of, "Do hypothetical legal risks affect criminal behavior?" -> cannot answer the policy question, "Will changes in actual punishment levels affect individual-level perceptions which will then cause changes in criminal behavior?"

### How do you propose to answer it?

* Survey a large number of urban residents, measure their perceived levels of punishment, and then measure how correlated their perceptions are with the actual objective numbers.
  
* 300 counties participate in the [[NJRP]] or National Judicial Reporting System run by [[BJS]] or the Bureau of Justice Statistics.
	* Within each county, a representative sample of criminal convictions is drawn. This allows for estimates of:
		* conviction rates per 100 arrested.
		* incarceration rates per 100 convicted.
		* average sentence imposed.
		* the average number of days between arrest and sentencing.
	* Use data from the 54 largest counties.
	* Generalizable to large urban counties in the USA which account for the majority of the crime in the country.
	* Interviewed 1500 people from each of the urban counties in 1998 using random digit dialing.
		* They asked people basically... "In the past 10 years, out of every 100 *crime type*, how many do you think resulted in an arrest?"
		* Ask about criminal homicide, robbery, aggravated assault, and burglary.
	  
* Use [[UCR]], Universal Crime Report data, to create measures of:
	* Total arrests per 100 offenses known to the police.
	  
* Variety of controls are included (e.g., how serious is the crime problem in your neighborhood, do you work in CJ, have you been arrested, how much news do you consume, demographic info).
  
* Use [[OLS]] [[Multilevel modeling|multilevel modeling]]. Unit 1 observations are individuals and unit 2 observations are counties. Estimate if perceptions of crime are correlated with actual levels of crime.

### What do you find?

* Descriptive table 2 -> No evidence that perceived levels of crime are correlated with actual levels of crime.
* Tables 3 through 7 -> Really no strong, consistent evidence that levels of punishment are related to individuals' perceptions of punishment.
* Tables 8 and 9 -> No real difference for people arrested vs. people not arrested.
* #quote (pg. 31 of PDF, 653 in document). "... increase in punishment levels do not routinely reduce crime through general deterrence mechanisms."
	* Does not mean deterrence effects do not exist. Rather, any deterrent effect does not covary with actual punishment levels.
	* People do weigh perceived risks and rewards, but they typically have so little information that the capacity for rational decision making is inoperative.
* Policy recommendations:
	* Crime control needs to find strategies to reduce crime that do not rely upon general deterrence.
		* Redirect resources from the criminal justice system by reducing levels of punishment towards generating jobs and improving the social safety net.
	* Find new methods for generating effective deterrence messages and accurately communicating the risks of crime.
		* Publicized punishment events.
