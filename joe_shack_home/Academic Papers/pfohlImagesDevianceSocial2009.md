## My notes

### Chapter 5 - Social disorganization theory

#### Social, political, and economic background

* The [[Chicago School]] emerged from the shadows of [[WWI]] which had dampened the optimistic spirit sociologists had concerning their ability to find rational solutions for the betterment of society through scientific inquiry.
* The [[USA sociology]] tradition emerged with a new *optimism* wherein [[sociology]] was not to be speculative but rigorously [[empirical]] (whether [[quantitative]] or [[qualitative]]) and with this new attitude came the abandonment of the goal of [[reform]] and instead allegiance to [[scientific neutrality]].
* [[Immigration]] (external and internal), [[industrialization]], and [[urbanization]] caused great upheaval and rapid change. Displaced persons had little opportunity to organize (plus the [[US government]] under [[Woodrow Wilson]] put down [[strikes]] and [[unions]] thus crippling those movements). Additionally [[capitalists]] began to accrue more and more power but also so did the merging [[managerial class]] who emphasized centralized control and [[technocratic]] expertise.
* Capitalists and managers wanted a stable social climate to conduct business. So this new, liberal class viewed social problems as natural by-products which were to be professionally managed. Chicago school got big boosts in funding from the [[Rockefeller family]]. This, in turn, helped establish UChicago as the center of sociological thought. *Depoliticized social problems* -> naturally caused, technically correctable.

  #### Beginnings of SD
  
* Seed was planted by [[W. I. Thomas]] and [[Florian Znaniecki]] for social disorganization theory from 1918 - 1920.
* [[Park & Burgess]] expand with the *zones* idea. Cities are ecological habitats:
	1. Invasion of new ideas and concepts and changes to society.
	2. Conflict for dominance between new and old ideas.
	3. Eventually some new order emerges. 
	4. New order or symbiosis is achieved.
	5. Throughout the conflict stage, the community super-organism loses control over its component parts leading to deviance.
* Later expanded by everyone’s favorite [[Shaw and McKay]].

#### Strengths

* Blended quantitative and qualitative methods into a coherent whole.
* Emphasized society and not the individual (also those deviant individuals are just like us). Was able to shed previous delusions about the inevitably of rational progress without then becoming pessimistic about the usefulness of social science.

#### Limitations

* However, some practical, policy projects to put the ideas of social disorganization theory into practice never really worked i.e., [[Chicago Area Project]] and related Boston project.
* There were some benefits. Greater ties between community organizers and local youth. Increased recreational outlets, access to educational and occupational opportunities, greater citizen involvement, etc. Not really any impact, though, on juvenile delinquency.
* For critic [[Terrence Morris]], this represents the failure of SD to account for structured social inequality. Attempts to *organize* communities only addresses symptoms of this deeper issue.

#### Theoretical limitations

* Never was made clear how to operationalize and measure [[social disorganization]]. High proportion of working women, high proportion of unmarried men, high number of persons per household?
* Does not address white collar crime.
* Viewed [[slums]] and their development as natural byproducts of change. Could be just as equally true they’re the product of unequal distribution of resources. Disorganization, for critics, is a historical by-product of social domination by the powerful.
