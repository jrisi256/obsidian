## Abstract

Agnew's [[anomie|General Strain Theory]] (GST) has come to be recognized as an increasingly important explanation for violence at the individual level. Drawing on this individual level theory, [[agnewGeneralStrainTheory1999]] recently suggested that GST might also be applicable to explaining variations in community crime rates. This macro level General Strain Theory (MST) has, however, rarely been empirically examined. This article provides an examination of some of the central ideas in Agnew's MST using data from sixty-six neighborhoods in a southern state. The findings presented here suggest that neighborhood disadvantage and stability significantly affect neighborhood levels of strain. In turn, strain significantly affects levels of violence. The extent to which the effects of strain on violence are conditioned by levels of informal social control and social support/capital are also examined in this article. The results are partially supportive of MST.

### Introduction

* Neighborhood disadvantage is associated with neighborhood levels of strain which in turn are associated with the level of violence.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CE847SIQ?page=511&annotation=SYQ2STN5) “The findings presented here suggest that neighborhood disadvantage and stability significantly affect neighborhood levels of strain. In turn, strain significantly affects levels of violence.” ([Warner and Fowler, 2003, p. 511](zotero://select/library/items/3HZVH97G))
	  
* Strain comes from not being treated fairly and from the loss of the ability to achieve one's goals.

Hence, increased levels of strain produce a ‘‘charged’’ environment conducive to crime, particularly violent crime.” ([Warner and Fowler, 2003, p. 512](zotero://select/library/items/3HZVH97G))
	  
* **Hypothesis 1**: Neighborhood characteristics (e.g., disadvantage and residential mobility) will increase strain
* **Hypothesis 2**: Higher levels of strain will increase neighborhood levels of violence and will partially mediate the effects of neighborhood characteristics on violence.
* **Hypothesis 3**: Strain will make models more predictive of violence (even with models which include measures of informal social control).
* **Hypothesis 4**: The effects of strain on violence will be moderated by informal social control and social capital/social ties. Strain will be more likely to lead to violence in neighborhoods with low informal social control and low social capital.
* Basically -> neighborhood disadvantage increases strain which will increase levels of violence.

### Data

* Data is at the census block level (66 block groups) and is based on survey responses from two large cities in a southern state. Each city had over 250,000 people.

#### Independent variables

* Measures of neighborhood characteristics came from the census. [[Concentrated disadvantage]] and residential stability.
* Measures of strain came from the survey. The mediating variables.

	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CE847SIQ?page=514&annotation=JZU34BPT) “Three survey items were used to represent these aspects of strain. Respondents were asked, ‘‘Thinking back over the last three months, have you or anyone in received threats or insults, felt cheated by someone, been harassed by the police force?” ([Warner and Fowler, 2003, p. 514](zotero://select/library/items/3HZVH97G))
* Measures of informal social control came from the survey. The moderating variables. Seem very similar to survey questions around [[Collective efficacy|collective efficacy]]

#### Dependent Variable

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CE847SIQ?page=516&annotation=BW5UQRVU) “The measure of violence used here was based on survey data. In part, this was because official counts of crime focused predominantly on serious violence reported to the police, and disadvantaged neighborhoods might be less likely to report some crimes to the police.” ([Warner and Fowler, 2003, p. 516](zotero://select/library/items/3HZVH97G))
	* Had you seen or heard about a fight in which a weapon was used? weapon was not used? sexual assault or rape? robbery or mugging? a spouse or partner being hit?

### Results

* **Table 3**: Neighborhood characteristics affected the amount of strain in a neighborhood and the amount of informal social control. As disadvantage and stability decreased, strain increased and social control decreased.
* **Table 4**: Both strain and and informal social control mediate the effects of neighborhood characteristics (see model 2 and 3) when included separately.
	* When both strain and social control are included in the same model, informal social control becomes imprecisely estimated and thus loses significance.

* **Table 5**
	* Models 1 and 2 -> surprisingly in high informal social control neighborhoods, strain retains its positive association with crime. In low informal social control neighborhoods, it loses significance. #theory_challenge Measurement issues driving the results? See below quote.
	* Models 3 and 4 -> Comports more with expectations. Strain is not significant in neighborhoods with high levels of social support, but it is significant in neighborhoods with low social support.

	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CE847SIQ?page=519&annotation=WY4BFS6N) “MST hypothesized that the effects of strain on crime would be stronger in communities with low levels of social control, the findings reported here suggested that, if anything, strain increased violence only in neighborhoods with high levels of informal social control. The test of significance for differences between coefficients, however, was not significant suggesting that informal social control might not significantly moderate the effects of strain on violence. In part, this finding might be because the sample was simply divided at the mean to create low and high informal social control neighborhoods. Hence, many of the neighborhoods in the low social control group (defined as less than 56 percent say neighbors were very likely to intervene) may not adequately represent true levels of low informal social control. Analyses using a more theoretically derived definition of low informal social control may provide better results. Unfortunately, the limited number of neighborhoods in this sample made it difficult to examine lower levels of informal social control.” ([Warner and Fowler, 2003, p. 519](zotero://select/library/items/3HZVH97G))
