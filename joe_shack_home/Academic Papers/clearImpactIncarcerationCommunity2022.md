## Abstract

The purpose of the chapter is to provide data and theory to support three propositions: Incarceration rates have grown in concentrated ways, especially effecting poor minority males who come from impoverished neighborhoods. High levels of incarceration, concentrated in impoverished neighborhoods, damage the social capital of those who live there, destabilizing the capacity for informal social control. Reductions in informal social control have devastating consequences for public safety and public health.
