## Abstract

The purpose of the chapter is to provide data and theory to support three propositions: Incarceration rates have grown in concentrated ways, especially effecting poor minority males who come from impoverished neighborhoods. High levels of incarceration, concentrated in impoverished neighborhoods, damage the social capital of those who live there, destabilizing the capacity for informal social control. Reductions in informal social control have devastating consequences for public safety and public health.
## Concentration of incarceration

### Age
* Incarceration is largely dominated by the young. 75% of prisoners are ages 18 - 44 despite being only 40% of the total US population.
* Strong cohort effects rather than period effects which is also driving up the number of older prisoners.
### Gender
* Adult men are about 50% of the US population, but they make up 93% of the prison population.
### Race
* Racial disparities have been declining since the prison population peaked in 2007. However, the racial disparities which still exist are quite massive with Black-Americans making up 12% of the total population but 33% of the prison population. Hispanics make up 16% of the total population but 23% of the prison population.
### Poverty
* Poor people go to prison at much higher rates than those who are more well-off. Those who enter prison are typically those with low human capital (under-educated, under-employed, and under-skilled). Due to racial and economic segregation, those who wind up becoming incarcerated tend to concentrate in impoverished neighborhoods. In some deeply poor neighborhoods in major cities, a significant percentage of adult males (usually Black) have been incarcerated.

## Effects

### Social networks
* Poor people have lower levels of social capital (i.e., the capacity for an individual to obtain goods through relationships with others) than non-poor people because they have a smaller social network (i.e., the set of relationships a person can call upon for help). Social networks are the foundation of social capital.
	* Poor individuals have social networks which are dominated by strong ties. This means they are reciprocal, not very diverse, and are likely to include people who have the same social network as them. They do not have as many weak ties which are useful for learning about new opportunities and accessing new resources.
	* Poor people's social networks usually are limited to their local residential area.
	* Young men tend to enlarge social networks. They take jobs which generated employment-related social ties, and they leave the immediate physical area to generate new social ties. When young men are imprisoned, several things happen:
		* Many family members maintain contact with the incarcerated individual which represents an opportunity cost. The time is spent maintaining the relationship with the individual in prison rather than expanding and strengthening a social network. Research tends to show that incarceration weakens or destabilizes already depleted networks by reducing the size of the social network. #highlight #papers_to_read 
		* The depletion in family members' social networks through incarceration damages the community as a whole in a cumulative way. Families' social networks have temporary damage inflicted upon them and would normally be compensated by turning to others. This is not possible in communities affected by mass incarceration where virtually every family is affected.  All families must deal with their weakened and shrinking social networks and are less able to be a source of help for others. State and volunteer organizations must pick up the slack.
		* See [[hunterPrivateParochialPublic1985]]. Incarceration strains private and parochial controls. Parochial controls fail because there are often not enough adults left to sustain them. There is too much outward mobility which inhibits the formation of long-term relationships necessary for parochial control to be effective.

### Safety and Health
* **Health outcomes for the incarcerated individual** --> Have higher rates of STIs as well as substance abuse and mental health disorders. For some population groups (particularly Black males), they have lower mortality due to decreased risk of violence while incarcerated, reduced access to drugs, and access to health care. However, these gains tend to disappear once released.
* **Health outcomes for the community** --> High rates of incarceration increases the likelihood of STIs as well as teenage pregnancies. #highlight #papers_to_read 
	* Caused by disruption to social structures and social networks. E.g., communities with high rates of incarceration have less men than women which increases the likelihood of concurrent sexual partners which increases likelihood of STIs and teenage pregnancies.
* **Health outcomes for family** --> Fractures intact families and reduces marital prospects for formerly incarcerated individuals. This leads to high rates of single-parent families. They are also less able to provide economic support to the families with whom they cohabit.
* **Health outcomes for children of incarcerated** --> Truancy, academic under-performance, depression, anxiety, and violence through the fracturing of the parent-child bond.
	* Complexity of female incarceration. Incarcerated females tend to be the *most disadvantaged and vulnerable people in the USA*. As a result, there have been no clear findings as to the effect of female incarceration.
* See [[roseIncarcerationSocialCapital1998]] and explorations of the [[incarceration tipping point hypothesis]].
	* Author concludes the available math and data to model the relationship is not very satisfactory although they argue the weight of the evidence supports the hypothesis (mostly a logical or theoretical argument: i..e, we know incarceration has all these negative effects which should increase crime so why would it not?) #question
