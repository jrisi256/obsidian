## My notes

### Chapters 3 and 4

* A get tough mentality permeates many workers in major institutions devoted to education, control and welfare. Why? Especially when these fields are oriented towards altruism and service? We see it with police recruits in terms of how they’re socialized during their initial training (as the author poses it, professionalism vs. pragmatism).
  
* The need to get things done in poorer neighborhoods overrides concerns of fairness.
  
* See the effects of police socialization on language. Affects one off the job (how could it not). Rituals (e.g. coffee).
  
* Patrol officers are at the bottom of the totem pole. They have the most boring and routine jobs. Specialists handle much of the interesting work. However even they must have proper training to avoid routine encounters escalating to violence.
  
* New officers learn from older officers what the standards are for arrests. Officers decide for themselves how and when to apply the law. It’s ambiguous.
  
* Those communities which need police protection rarely receive it (police rationalize it on the basis of it’s just the way it is). Pursuing it would be inefficient.
  
* Five Year Man → After about 5 years, the patrolman will look for a good detail in order to escape foot patrol duty.
  
* When Jewish officers first entered the force, they were subject to a great deal of prejudice from the largely Irish police forces. Jewish families are often disappointed in their children becoming police officers.
  
* Detectives are exalted.
  
* Sergeants hold a dual role nowadays where some are seen as being more allied with labor. This represents quite the shift from older times due to increasing democratization and demilitarization. Influx of college-educated officers. Increasing professionalization and managerial roles.
  
* Old timers possess a soul-searching type of introspection. They take it upon themselves to impart wisdom unto the youngsters.
  
* Long section on anomie in the police force → professionalization is changing and old values are being replaced with new ones which causes a great deal of uncertainty and hopelessness. How can one rise to the top of one’s station? What is the ceiling? Officers are above the law → cynicism develops in themselves and in humanity. “Everyone is always trying to get away with something.” But also cynicism in the profession (amongst patrol officers, professionals want to transform it) → higher rate of suicide amogst police officers and may be absorbed by delinquent occupational subculture.
