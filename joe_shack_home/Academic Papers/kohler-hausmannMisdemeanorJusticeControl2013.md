## Abstract

Current scholarship has explored how the carceral state governs and regulates populations. This literature has focused on prison and on the wide-reaching collateral consequences of a felony conviction. Despite the obvious importance of these findings, they capture only a portion of the criminal justice system’s operations. In most jurisdictions, misdemeanors, not felonies, constitute the bulk of criminal cases, and the number of such arrests is rising. This article explores a puzzling fact about New York City’s pioneering experiment in mass misdemeanor arrests: the preponderance result in no finding of guilt and no assignment of formal punishment. Drawing on two years of fieldwork, this article explores how the criminal justice system functions to regulate significant populations without conviction or sentencing. The author details the operation of penal power through the techniques of marking through criminal justice record keeping, the procedural hassle of case processing, and mandated performance evaluated by court actors to show the social control capacity of the criminal justice system.

## My notes

**What is the research question?** → Why do most misdemeanor arrests have a finding of no guilt and no assignment to formal punishment?
    
- Examine NYC and penal practices which led to policing tactics focused on enforcement against low-level offenses. Puzzling departure from mass incarceration → climbing misdemeanor arrests but also higher dismissal rates.
    
- “The process itself is punishment.” → How does this processing of cases (combined with practical constraints and ideologies/interests of sponsoring agencies) give rise to techniques of social control?
    
**Why is it important?** → Most research on how the carceral state governs and regulates populations has typically focused on felony convictions, not misdemeanors. However arrest categories are largest for misdemeanors (crimes which usually do not carry a prison/jail sentence).
    
- Misdemeanor justice is thus one of the dominant components of criminal justice and social control → retreat from mass incarceration does not mean a retreat from power exercised over marginal populations.
    
- Studying misdemeanor justice broadens our gaze beyond the prison to understand the role of penal power in social regulation. We understate the reach of the criminal justice system when only considering those formally punished.
    
**How do you answer it?** → Drawing on two years of fieldwork and interviews in New York City, primarily consisting of ethnographic observation of misdemeanor courts.

**What do you find?**
    
- The criminal justice system regulates populations without convictions or sentencing → achieve control through methods other than formal rules → very intentional.
    
- Operation of penal power through these conceptual schema (not objectively identifiable, discrete types of actions):
    
	- **Marking** → Criminal justice record keeping. Generation, maintenance, and regular use of official records that one is involved with the CJ system. Keep track of them in the outside world.
    
	- **Procedural Hassle** of case processing. Burdens and opportunity costs attendant to complying with the legal proceedings. Long waiting times and confusing processes → “Do you really deserve to be punished? Can you withstand our tests?”
    
	- **Mandate performance** → Evaluated by court actors to show the social control capacity of the CJ system. Formal demands beforehand by the court or as evidence of responsibility or rehabilitation after the fact.
    
- These 3 techniques allow criminal justice actors to trace, engage, and discipline subjects even as they’re formally shown leniency and release from penal control.
    
- Structure of penal techniques serve the ends of sorting (good from bad citizens), testing (will you follow rules), and regulating (enforcing norms through reward and punishment) for significant chunks of the population without long-term removal, total control, or permanent marking.
    
- Courtroom actors purposefully use these modes of penal power despite sometimes widely varying intentions → commensurate punishment or going-rates (X amount of hassle vs. Y amount of formal punishment).
    
### Questions

1. The connection to the [[Minority threat hypothesis]] from this paper seems to be pretty clear to me i.e. state resources and institutions will be used to control populations deemed threatening to the majority. Do you think this is a relationship which necessarily needs to hold true? Do you think there is some movement today in policies and cultural beliefs which could change this relationship (e.g. liberalization of marijuana laws, progressive DAs)? Or do you think regardless of these changes, state control of marginal, threatening populations will always take on some new form?
    
2. What implications do you think this paper (and other papers we’ve read in previous weeks but especially this week) have for our ability to erect positive change in the criminal justice system?
    
3. On the one hand, it isn’t like policy doesn’t matter. We see how courtroom work group practices were different presumably because of the introduction of sentencing guidelines or other policies like rotating judges. On the other hand, there was significant heterogeneity in how the guidelines were used (and not used). Local contexts significantly shaped how courtrooms implemented the guidelines regardless of the intentions of those who created them. Does this mean despite our best efforts we won’t be able to achieve the change we wish to see? Is this way of thinking too totalizing or either-or?
    
4. How does the idea of misdemeanor justice, and in particular its focus on control, relate to the idea of efficiency that we’ve discussed in the class before? For whom is the process efficient? Is there a point in making the process intentionally inefficient? What are some consequences for the system as a whole that stem from the manufactured inefficiencies of misdemeanor justice?
    
5. Recall the two symbolic meanings of courts proposed by Eisenstein et al. in Contours of Justice: the courts act as assurance that criminals get punished, and that the Law limits the coercive role of the government. In contrast, Kohler-Hausmann argues that to assume that the courts exclusively punish and incarcerate people is a misunderstanding of the bureaucracy of the court. How do the ideas of misdemeanor justice and control either align with or contrast with the symbolic meanings of the courts? Are the symbolic meanings exclusive to violent crime? Do the courts symbolize something different in misdemeanor cases?
