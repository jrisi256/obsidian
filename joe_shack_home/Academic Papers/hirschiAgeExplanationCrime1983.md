## Abstract

One of the few facts agreed on in criminology is the age distribution of crime. This fact has been used to criticize social theories of crime causation, to provide the foundation for other theories, to justify recent emphases on career criminals, and to support claims of superiority for longitudinal designs in criminological research. In the present paper, we argue that the age distribution of crime is sufficiently invariant over a broad range of social conditions that these uses of the age distribution are not justified by available evidence.

## My notes

The main theses of the paper:

1. The age distribution of _**the tendency to commit criminal acts**_ is invariant across social and cultural conditions.
    
	1. Give examples of the age-crime curve from different time periods and from different places which exhibited the familiar right-skew.
	2. The age effect remains even when differentiating by sex and race.
	3. Property vs. personal crimes
		1. At first glance, the age distribution of property crimes vs. personal crimes are different which would seemingly negate this hypothesis.
		2. However they only appear different if one uses officially reported data (like the data reported by the FBI in the [[UCR]]).
		3. If one uses self-report data (like from the National Crime Victimization Survey), one finds personal and property offenses peak in the mid-teens which corresponds with property offenses also peaking in the mid-teens (according to official data). Meanwhile personal offenses peak in the early 20’s according to official data.
		4. The difference in these peak years may be accounted for by age-related differences in the consequences of personal vs. property crimes.
			1. For example, personal crimes tend to become _**more**_ _**serious**_ with each new offense.
			2. Property crimes tend to _**not become more serious**_ with subsequent offenses.
			3. Age is correlated with the number of offenses (people who’ve committed more offenses tend to be older).
			4. Thus age is correlated with the seriousness of personal offenses but not property offenses.
			5. Thus personal offenses by the very young will often not be serious enough to attract the attention of officials.
		5. The tendency to commit property offenses (official or self-reported) and the tendency to commit personal offenses (self-reported) both peak before the **necessary physical strength** has appeared to to commit a serious offense.
			1. Thus in officially reported statistics, the peak age for personal offenses is a confluence of “tendency” and “ability”. Strength continues to grow after the peak age of criminality has been reached, the age-crime curve for personal crimes declines from a later age.
			2. Stated simply, “the increase in physical strength and thus dangerousness and ability to commit serious crimes more than offsets the tendency to commit an offense”. #quote 
		6. The slower decline of person offenses (in official data) may reflect the fact that a greater proportion of personal offenses are primary group conflicts. Primary group personal offenses are assumed to be relatively constant throughout one’s life.
			1. Authors claim if you were to subtract out these primary group personal offenses from the total number of personal offenses, the slow decline would not be so slow and thus would look like a normal age-crime curve.
		7. Presents a puzzle for their thesis since they claim the age effect is invariant. This would appear to be a situation in which there is a social/cultural condition in which the age effect is not invariant. However, this example illustrates, instead, that the age effect is always there, but there may be some countervailing social processes which obscure it, making it appear weaker than it actually is once the countervailing force is accounted for/removed. **What the fuck? This is so open ended.**
		8. Footnote 9. Made the change in hypothesis 1 from “crime”. Why? Well because various social/cultural conditions could explain why the age-crime curve disappeared. If we get everybody locked up in straightjackets, the age-crime curve would disappear. The authors claim, though, that this would not make the “tendency to commit criminal acts” and its relation to age disappear. **Their lack of explaining how to falsify their claim is infuriating**.
	4. Some theories claim the age effect would disappear if children and adults were in identical situations. E.g. if differential labor force participation is the reason for differential propensities to commit crime, we would have to create an environment with the same labor force participation rates for everyone. This is obviously hard to do. So a lot of this research has focused on studying prisoners, since things are more or less held constant there. However, even in prison, the age effect is still there.
	5. Automobile accidents exhibit a similar curve to the age-crime curve. I think they’re trying to say the age effect appears in other domains similar to but lacking many of the features which are typically assumed to cause crime. As a result, this suggests something deeper than the variables criminologists usually study is at play.

2. Theories of crime that do not attempt to explain the age distribution are under no logical or empirical obligation to do so and should not be critiqued based on their inability to do so.
    
	1. How criminology research usually goes. You pick your variable to explain crime. You divide your sample into those with a lot of exposure to the variable and into those with not a lot of exposure. You can then compare the crime rates.
	   
	2. However most theories run into the issue that they cannot explain the aging out effect. E.g. “Social bond/control theory cannot account for desistance as subjects get older. Are we supposed to believe that through some mechanism, uniformly across the board, social bonds are strengthened as age increases?”
	   
	3. The authors point out, though, that the age-effect could (and they in fact argue always does) appear when you differentiate between groups with low exposure to the variables and high exposure to the high variables. The age-effect is constant between the two groups so your theory doesn’t have to explain anything. E.g. take car accidents. No one thinks driver training as a variable is inadequate as an explanation for the variation of car accidents among drivers BECAUSE it fails to explain why younger drivers get into more accidents.

3. The age distribution of crime cannot be accounted for by any variable currently available to criminology.
	1. A corollary of the first thesis really. Since no cultural or social condition/variable can cause the age effect to disappear, this suggests they cannot explain why it’s happening either. And since the age effect appears in other analogous domains as crime (e.g. car accidents), but which don’t share a lot of the variables used to explain crime, suggests something deeper is afoot.
	2. Let’s examine Greenberg’s theory of crime which accounts for or explains the age effect. “Strain and control theory”. Strain comes from youth being deprived access to the means of production leading to material deprivation and masculine status anxiety. Control enters through increasing legal penalties and increasing social integration (“stakes of conformity”). Less strain as you get older (**sure**) and more control.
		1. The four facts the strain part explain are: **1)** why peak age of crime is late adolescence (when you want most but have least amount of ability to satisfy those wants) **2)** skip, don’t understand **3)** Peak age varies by type of offense (adolescents commit more property crimes, consistent with theory), **4)** Offenses decline in number with age (more control and less strain).
		2. **Some issues though with the strain theory.** Strain theory predicts that employed teens will be less likely to steal and teens with access to legitimate funds will be less likely to steal. Data does not support these predictions. Furthermore, little reason to believe if a theory cannot predict cross-sectional differences that it could predict longitudinal differences.
		3. Another issue with Greenberg’s theory is that depending on the causal factors given in a particular context, the age-crime curve will be different at different times in different places even as the authors claim it’s invariant.
		4. The final issue is Greenberg attempts to explain why the peak age varies with time, place, and type of offense (personal vs. property). Particularly type of offense. As discussed earlier, this is due to differential response by officials (as self-report data reflects no difference in peak age by type of crime). The idea that there are differential causal factors which motivate an individual to commit a property vs. a personal crime (which we’ve already seen to be a result of differential response on the part of law enforcement due to lack of ability to cause personal harm, additionally no evidence that people only commit one type of crime) AND that these factors are changing overtime with age (which causes one to become more involved with personal rather than property crime) is not true (**and also how the hell you going to be prove that rigorously**).
		5. **Some issues with control theory**. **Problem 1**. We would expect there to be a discontinuous decline in the rate of crime since it’s a sharp cutoff when legal sanctions begin to be imposed more sharply. Instead, it’s a continuous, monotonic decline.
		6. **Problem 2**. It’s a plausible account for why crime might decline between the ages of say 19 and 24. It isn’t plausible in explaining why crime declines between the ages of say 29 and 34. Furthermore, the rate of decline in offending is the same between these two groups suggesting the explanation being offered by Greenberg isn’t explaining anything.
		7. **Problem 3**. If you read into Greenberg’s reasoning closely, it suggests the age of peak criminality is even higher than crime statistics might suggest (since they get reported less often due to seriousness and less punished). This would call into question a lot of the explanations since 14 year olds have less material wants and needs when compared to 17 year olds (which is traditionally when criminality is said to peak).
			1. For sake of argument, let’s assume the peak age has gotten younger over time. From Greenberg, we would assume the social position of the youths is changing. I.e. the social position of 14 year olds today is not the same as the social position of 14 year olds 60 years ago hence the difference in peak age of crime.
			2. So if the peak crime of today is _really_ 14 and the peak crime of 60 years ago was _really_ 17, then the social conditions of those two groups must be the same.
			3. This means then in 1842 Wales when the peak age of crime was 25, these 25 year olds had the same social conditions as 14 year olds today in the USA.
		8. In conclusion, Greenberg thinks **1)** theories constructed to explain delinquency in other contexts (sex) can also be useful to help explain age and can also be used to choose the best theories **2)** Any biological or psychological explanations for delinquency have a hard time dealing with the fact that there is a great deal of variation in delinquency amongst similar aged people AND have a hard time explaining the late peak of personal offenses.
			1. The rejoinder is that there is really no logical reason why if one theory explains differences in sex that it should then also explain age or vice versa.
			2. Additionally just because there is within-age variation, this would not discredit a theory for similar reasons espoused under hypothesis 2.
			   
4. Explanations focusing on the age effect must take into account the fact that age has a direct effect on crime.
   
5. The theories and other conceptual tools that have been built up around trying to explain the age effect are redundant and misleading.
	1. Criminologists are increasingly interested in the career criminal idea. Many statistics show a small percentage of offenders contribute to a large percentage of offenses. This suggests if we split these two groups (sporadic offenders vs. career criminals), the sporadic offenders would have an age-crime curve similar to the familiar one whereas the career criminals’ age-crime curve could look very different. The most common curve depends on the age of onset meaning the younger the age of first crime, the older the age of desistance. Another competing model suggests all criminal careers are roughly equal in length.
	2. Beginning of page 575, there is this sort of involved discussion of age of onset.
		1. Larger proportion of nonwhites vs. whites commit offenses at an earlier age. This is interpreted as nonwhites begin offending at an earlier age than whites. The question becomes, “Why?”
		2. A technical discussion follows where nonwhite youth are more likely to be first arrested between the ages of 7 and 13 vs. white youth who are more likely to be arrested for the first time between the ages of 14 and 17.
		3. The reason for this is because the proportion of nonwhites who have already been arrested becomes sufficiently large that the relative increase in nonwhite first offenders cannot keep pace with the relative increase in white first offenders.
		4. In reality what’s happening is nonwhite youth are more likely to be found delinquent vs. their white youth counterparts at all age categories. Has nothing whatsoever to do with “age of onset”. The differences in age of onset are purely for mechanical reasons.
		5. At any given age, nonwhite offenders are more likely than white offenders to have more prior caught offenses. Since the proportion of nonwhite offenders with prior offenses approaches the theoretical limit faster than white offenders, at some point the proportion of “new” offenders among white offenders will be larger than the proportion of “new” offenders among nonwhite offenders. The naive will say these means whites start later than nonwhites.
		6. In my own words, the fact that whites “start later” than nonwhites results purely from the fact that nonwhites are caught offendering more in each age group. As a logical consequence of this fact, whites are more likely to have their first offense come later in life than nonwhites (since so many more of the nonwhites had their first offense early in life). No more explanation is needed than that.
	3. Age of desistance.
		1. Similar complaints around age of onset. High-rate groups will have high rates of recidivism leading to higher rates of career offenders. All mechanical and logical necessities which do not need further explanation.
		2. What about if earlier onset of criminal behavior led to an earlier age of desistance? Authors claim that invariant age-crime curves preclude this possibility and furthermore that there has been no group found with relatively high early rates of caught crime while also having low later rates of caught crime.
		   
6. Identification of the causes of crime at any age may suffice to identify them at other ages as well. As a result longitudinal designs are not necessary for the proper study of why people commit crime.
	1. Takedown of Shannon. Everything in section 5 comes in to play here. They are basically saying anytime anybody says something like “delinquency at an early age predicts delinquency later in life” reduces to delinquency predicts delinquency because high-rate groups are high-rate in every age category. Most interesting line, “... identification of the causes of crime at one age suffices to identify them at other ages as well…” #quote 
	2. What about life-course events correlated with age and thought to affect crime like marriage, school, and employment? As a rejoinder, marriage is not seen as affecting crime. Additionally the persistence of the age effect in incarcerated populations casts doubt on the assumption life-course events would be responsible for the decrease in criminality. Additionally, the age-crime curve wouldn’t be so invariant to culture if life-course events played a role (should be different in different cultures).
	   
7. Conclusion
	1. Age is not useful in predicting involvement in crime over the life cycle of offenders. For predicting subsequent criminal involvement, to know that a child of 10 committed a delinquent act is no more useful than knowing a child of 15 committed one. Which is pretty profound since most criminologists believe the younger you start, the more likely that behavior is to persist.
	2. Footnote 16 explains it well. Longitudinal researchers present evidence saying age of first crime is a key predictor of future crime. This takes the form of delinquency measured at t - 1, t - 2, and t - 3, points in time for example. Taking what the longitudinal people say as true, this would mean t - 1 does a better job of predicting the delinquent outcome at t - 3 than t - 2 does. This is simply not true.
		1. What are longitudinal researchers really saying? Looking back over the careers of offenders, one finds that those who have committed many offenses over a long period of time have also committed offenses when they were young. Put another way, there are probably a lot of people with their first offense caught when they were young who did not go on to become career criminals.
