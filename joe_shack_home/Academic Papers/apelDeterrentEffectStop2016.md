## My notes

### Introduction

* Begins by talking about a study which examined the effects of stop & frisk in NYC. The study found strong evidence that stop & frisk deterred crime and also provided a diffusion of benefits wherein crime declined in a short radius around the hot spot and crime declined for several days afterwards as well.
  
* However, the author of this paper argues the crime control effects of stop & frisk are ambiguous. **1)** What is the marginal deterrence of stop & frisk? **2)** Can we pinpoint the effects of stop & frisk exclusively to stop & frisk or might other policies be responsible? **2a)** In a related fashion, what parts of stop & frisk are responsible for its supposed deterrent effects that would differentiate it from other hot spots policing tactics? **3)** Are the results due to changes in offender behavior or victim behavior?

* **Typology of police actions**
  
	* High focus vs. low focus -> High focus tactics are targeted at certain places or certain people where certain kinds of crime are known to be concentrated.
	  
	* High diversity vs. low diversity -> Low diversity tactics rely narrowly on the coercive legal authority of the police. High diversity tactics engage with the community and rely upon methods other than the explicit legal authority of the police to gain compliance with the law.

* Stop & frisk can fit into the typology in a variety of ways. If it is used in a targeted fashion in an area with a lot of gun violence recently, it is high focus. If used indiscriminately, it will be low focus (and can entail a lot of backlash and costs which undermine its efficacy).
  
* Stop & frisk operates under the logic of certainty enhancement (as opposed to severity and swiftness) i.e., by making punishment and detection more certain, offenders are less likely to offend. Assumes criminal actors are rational agents responding to changes in incentives and risks. Also allows for the removal of lethal weapons which might not reduce the probability of a dispute but certainly reduces the probability the dispute would become lethal.

### Puzzle

* Crime is at historic laws in the history of NYC. However, the size of its police force and prisons have been declining since 2000. This seems to fly in the face of what is suggested by deterrence theory which is that more police officers can lead to reductions in crime and incarceration can have modest deterrent effects.
  
* Is it possible that stop & frisk helped compensate for the shortfall created by cuts in the criminal justice system? It allowed for more crime control via deterrence with fewer police officers on the street and fewer offenders being locked up.

#### Difficulties in evaluating stop & frisk

1. What component parts constitute the policy? I.e., what is actually happening during the administering of the stop and frisk policy which is driving its effects?
2. Stop & frisk is effective relative to what? What's the counterfactual? It's hardly ever zero police activity. The policy implications are always marginal deterrence -> stop & frisk is *this* much more deterrent relative to *this* baseline.
3. Are other interventions happening at the same time partially or fully responsible for the observed effects instead? Author points to the proliferation of public and private surveillance.

### Ethical considerations

* "Whatever the efficacy of SQF with respect to crime, it has apparently come at the expense of people who were mostly innocent of any wrongdoing." #quote (page 62 or page 6 of PDF) -> super low hit rates. Advocates would argue the reported hit rates are inaccurate because many would be offenders were deterred. Others might rightfully point out many, many innocent people are being targeted as a result.
  
* This raises the question of what is the mechanism stop & frisk is supposedly working through. The standard explanation is that would-be offenders curtail their behavior.
  
* Another explanation is that victims change their behavior.
	* Victims are less likely to frequent the hot spots for fear of being harassed by the police.
	* On the second point, aggressive use of stop & frisk could erode citizens' willingness to report crime.
