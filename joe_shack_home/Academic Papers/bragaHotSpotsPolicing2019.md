## Abstract

This updated systematic review assesses the effects of focused police crime prevention interventions at crime hot spots. The review also examined whether focused police actions at specific locations result in crime displacement or diffusion of crime control benefits.

## My notes

### Introduction

Identified 65 studies which attempted to assess the validity of hot spots policing. [[meta-analysis]] finds a small but significant mean effect size concerning the effect of hot spots policing on reducing crime in treatment areas relative to control areas. They also find a small but statistically significant effect on the diffusion of crime control benefits to adjacent areas rather than crime displacement.

Hot spots policing is a fairly robust crime prevention strategy. Furthermore, it does not seem as if hot spots policing results in crime displacement but rather the benefits seem to diffuse into proximate areas.

Operates through deterrence and crime opportunity reduction.

### Moderating factors

* Quasi-experimental studies generally found stronger effect sizes relative to experimental studies, but the effect sizes in both instances were negative.
  
* Studies which examined [[problem oriented policing]] generally found larger effect sizes relative to those which focused on traditional policing, but the effect sizes in both instances were negative.
	* Authors note that problem oriented policing holds a great deal of promise in changing the underlying conditions which continually give rise to crime.
	* Even still if a police department only wants to implement the *shallow* version of hot spots policing, it still seems efficacious.
  
* Results hold across a variety of outcomes although almost all are still somehow police-reported incidents. Different effect sizes for different crime types (violent crimes had lowest reductions and drug crimes had the highest reduction).
  
* Deal with publication bias by including a wide variety of studies including published reports, theses and dissertations, unpublished reports and working papers. Studies not reported in typical academic journals generally reported lower effect sizes.
  
* Using a [[trim and fill analysis]] to impute missing studies due to publication bias does not significantly alter the results.
