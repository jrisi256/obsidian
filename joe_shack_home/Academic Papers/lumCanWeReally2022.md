## Abstract

The protests following the killing of George Floyd in the summer of 2020 led to contentious discussions and debates in many cities about policing, with some calling to “defund the police.” However, this debate has generally proceeded without adequate research about either the scale or nature of issues that the police handle and the potential consequences of the proposed reform efforts. To respond to this research gap, we analyze millions of 911 calls for service across nine U.S. agencies. We report on the types of calls for service that the police handle, including how frequently different calls arise, how much time agencies spend on different categories of calls, and the outcomes of those calls. We find that the amount and types of incidents for which people call the police are voluminous, with the vast majority not obviously transferable to other organizations or government sectors without significant resource expenditures or adjustments. However, if the police retain these responsibilities, they also need to reconsider how they can more effectively address community concerns.

## My notes

### What is the research question?

What is the scale and nature of issues that police handle and respond to? What do people call the police for? And subsequently, how do the police spend their time? Understanding the answer to this question will help us understand potential consequences of defunding the police.
#### Importance

* Resources should be shifted away from law enforcement to other public services that may improve the quality of life from within marginalized communities.
  
* Police handle public challenges they are ill-equipped to handle. Furthermore, on principle, they should not be handling them.
  
* Involving the police can start the negative cycle of involvement in the criminal justice system. By reducing the footprint of the police, one can also reduce the direct harms caused by the police (e.g., illegitimate use of force and discriminatory behavior). 

### How do you propose to answer it?

Obtained computer-aided dispatch records across 9 agencies from the USA from 2016-2017. Report on calls for service (citizen initiated), how frequently they arise, how much time agencies spend on them, and the outcomes of those calls.

Agencies are pretty diverse.

Iteratively developed 14 categories which calls could fit into:
* 
### What do you find?

* 911 call takers resolve about half of all calls without any further criminal justice involvement. Many are for events like false alarms, traffic accidents, or people seeking information. Many still get passed on to law enforcement (some have to get passed on no matter how minor or unrelated to public safety because of organizational constraints and liability concerns).
  
* **Table 2** -> Most common call types tend to be related to: general disorder (noise violations, disorderly conduct, fireworks, drunk in public, etc.), traffic, and *suspicious activity*.
  
* **Table 3** -> Average time spent on each call category ranges from 10 minutes (alarms) to 85 minutes (medical). Typically, the police officers spend the longest time on calls related to people in mental or medical distress, missing persons, and violence. All three types of calls likely require the response of specialized units, written reports, specific procedural requirements, and perhaps even arrests.
  
* **Table 4** -> Percentage-wise, what do officers spend most of their time doing? Combination of table 2 and 3. Traffic, property crimes, and disorder calls.
  
* **Table 5** -> Most of the time (60% to 80% of calls received), the outcomes of these calls for service do not result in official police action -> most of the arrests/citations come from traffic incidents.
#### Big Picture Findings

Reducing the types of calls the police handle may not dramatically reduce arrest rates...

* "Again, diverse of these incidents (or the police simply not handling such calls for service) may be justified by other reasons, such as keeping kids out of the justice system to tangible results in prevention or reduction of recidivism."
  
* "... the challenge will become how to adjust community members' expectations about what police services they can demand."
  
* "... the often minor problems for which people regularly call the police are those they are most concerned about."
  
* "These calls are also spatially concentrated in places that lack access to other resources to resolve these problems." 

Many calls for service fall in categories that do not have obvious counterpart government organizations which could handle these calls instead.

If these responsibilities were to be transferred, they would have to be done in such a way so as to guarantee the safety and satisfaction of the community while also minimizing the potentials for disparity.

If the police maintain these responsibilities, efforts will need to be made to reconsider how the police can improve their handling these responsibilities.

* Cite [[naginDeterrenceTwentyFirstCentury2013]] for the deterrence and preventative role the police can play in preventing calls. #disagree -> Strongly disagree that Nagin's research points to how police can prevent these types of calls since these types of calls seem to be *mostly* unrelated to crime.
