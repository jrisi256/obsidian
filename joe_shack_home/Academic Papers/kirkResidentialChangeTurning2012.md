## Abstract

Many former prisoners return home to the same residential environment, with the same criminal opportunities and criminal peers, where they resided before incarceration. If the path to desistance from crime largely requires knifing off from past situations and establishing a new set of routine activities, then returning to one's old environment and routines may drastically limit an ex-prisoner's already dismal chances of desisting from crime. This study tests these ideas by examining how forced residential migration caused by Hurricane Katrina affected the likelihood of reincarceration among a sample of ex-prisoners originally from New Orleans, LA. Property damage from the hurricane induced some ex-prisoners who otherwise would have moved back to their former neighborhoods to move to new neighborhoods. Findings from an instrumental variables survival analysis reveal that those parolees who moved to a new parish following release were substantially less likely to be reincarcerated during the first 3 years after release than those ex-offenders who moved back to the parish where they were originally convicted. Moreover, at no point in the 3-year time period was the hazard of reincarceration greater for those parolees who moved than for those who returned to the same parish.

## My notes

### Research Question

- Are the benefits of residential change permanent or fleeting? Will they establish similar patterns of activities and hang out with similar groups of people? **Something not addressed but differential policing patterns**. #highlight #disagree 

- Does residential change provide a temporary cessation of criminal behavior or does it act as a true catalyst for desistance?

### Data and Methods

- Use Hurricane Katrina as a random instrument for selecting which ex-prisoners would be able to move back to their old neighborhood vs. those who were not able to move back to their old neighborhood.

- Sample prisoners released from Louisiana correctional facilities. A first cohort (control) from September 2001 to February 2002. A second cohort (treatment) from September 2005 to February 2006.
    
- Include controls for change (if any) in socioeconomic conditions between origin and destination parishes.
    
- Include controls for changes in the CJ system (judge caseloads, likelihood of arrest, average parole contacts per parole officer, base reincarceration rate).    

### Results

- Using [[instrumental variable]] [[survival analysis]] revealed that parolees who moved to a new _parish_ following release were substantially less likely to be re-incarcerated during the first 3 years after release. At no point during the 3 year period was the hazard of incarceration greater for those who moved.
    
- **Sensitivity Analyses** → Hurricane Katrina may have affected re-incarceration by mechanisms other than through residential migration. Despite statistical controls, there may still be unmeasured paths by which Hurricane Katrina affected re-incarceration. E.g. parole officers became more lenient. Uses the second cohort **only** and compares those who returned versus those who did not.
    
- “Presumably if Katrina had altered conditions conducive to re-incarceration (either positively or negatively), then comparing movers and stayers released only post-Katrina is one way to reduce the potential confounding influence of unmeasured predictors related to the devastation from Hurricane Katrina.” → Not sure how true this is… #disagree 

### Questions

#question 

- **Methodological question**: Are there any reasons we could think of why Hurricane Katrina might not be a good instrumental variable?
    
- Do you find it surprising that residential change produced such uniformly positive results in regards to recidivism (net of changes in socioeconomic context)? When might moving not produce better outcomes?
