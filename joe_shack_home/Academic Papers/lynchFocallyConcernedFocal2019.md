## Abstract

“Focal concerns” is the predominant theoretical framework in criminology for explaining disparities in sentencing outcomes. While the framework has generated a large body of empirical scholarship, its postulates remain inadequately tested in the criminological literature. In this paper, I offer a conceptual and methodological critique of [[focal concerns of courtroom actors]] as it is being deployed in a large body of sentencing research. I first trace the genealogy of the “focal concerns” concept and detail its current articulation. I then describe the body of work that has reduced “focal concerns” to a commonsense psychological construct, and illustrate the fallacies of logic and paucity of direct theory development and testing that weaken the explanatory value of the framework. I conclude by building on Ulmer’s recent call to treat criminal courts as “[[inhabited institutions]]” to assess approaches that are more social scientifically robust and empirically testable for understanding how sentencing disparity is produced.

## My notes

#paper_idea -> important for dissertation concerning how the legal vs. extralegal dichotomy should be challenged.

### Genealogy

- Focal concerns as an idea originates with Miller and his study of gangs. It was used to describe group-level processes though not individual-level cognitions, beliefs, or actions. What were the focal concerns of the group as a whole? Considerable overlap with cultural norms.
    
- Over time it was converted from a group-level measure to an individual-level measure particularly of self-perception.
    
- In sentencing research, Hoffman used the term, and it’s fully an individual-level construct. Then later its current conceptualization from Steffensmeier. Steffensmeier treats the focal concerns as operating at the individual-level but are also treated as shared understandings among a class of legal actors.
    
- Further individualized when it’s suggested the focal concerns are subject to heuristics, stereotypes, and other biases.

### Beginning of Problems

- Original Steffensmeier piece realized the quantitative work was not a direct test of focal concerns. The qualitative part was needed to address focal concerns. “...the authors’ message that cautioned against over-interpretation in the absence of direct measures of legal actors’ thoughts and behaviors seemed to get lost…” -> ironically qualitative work which could be used to confirm the hypothesis has been decoupled from it. #quote 
    
- Research has sprung up which uses multivariate regression models utilizing defendant-level data to measure disparities without any direct measures of judges’ decision-making processes or perceptions.

### Critiques

- Sentences are decided by the workings of courtroom actors and their relationships. Not fully at the discretion of the judge (even if that’s technically the case). Focal concerns literature elides over these group-level and contextual features. Reduces it to the internal cognitive mechanisms of the sentencing judge. Furthermore institutional racism highlights how an amalgam of larger forces interact with individual or group-level discretion (not the actions of a single, unconstrained actor, consciously or not, discriminating).
    
- Consideration of legal and extralegal factors. Legal factors are themselves the product of racialized processes. Or they are weighed in ways which interact with race. How presumptive sentences are shaped, how criminal history is considered.
    
- Think of [[Type B Discretion]] (the discrimination in the law).
    
- Even if we accept observed disparities are at least partly the result of individual judges, focal concerns is not grounded in the literature on bias and stereotyping from psychology.
    
- Most focal concerns scholars mobilize data sources and strategies which cannot directly or indirectly measure judges’ cognitive processes. Uses mostly observational case-level data in regression models. No individual level data on courtroom actors. No data available concerning prosecutorial discretion.
    
- The statistical work is descriptive, but it’s asserted as causal through theoretical frameworks (focal concerns) which speculate as to why the disparities arose in the first place. Gap between theory and what is measured. No measurement of individual courtroom actors and their intent. Simply describing disparities.
    
### Solutions

- Courts are [[inhabited institutions]]. Administrative data dehumanizes the deeply human processes which produce the data. Needs a bottoms-up approach which examines the interplay of courtroom actors.
    
- [[Multilevel modeling]] to capture local legal norms, cultures, and constraints which produce differences in outcomes across federal court districts.
    
- Complicate the legal/extralegal dichotomy. Capture how legal mechanisms produce disparity and inequality as embedded in and impacted by local legal culture. Supplemented by interview and survey data. Mixed-methods work.
    
- Bring in individual court actors into the data (have them be individually identifiable).
