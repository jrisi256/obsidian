## Abstract

Police scholars document that although there is fragmentation of the so-called “monolithic” police culture, historically consistent features of the occupational culture of police exist. By drawing on ethnographic observations in three U.S. police departments, I describe how one consistent feature of police culture—the preoccupation with danger and potential death—is maintained by the commemoration of officers killed in the line of duty. Through the use of commemorative cultural artifacts, officers and departments construct an organizational memory that locally reflects and reifies the salience of danger and potential death in policing. Furthermore, commemoration of fallen officers is not restricted to a department's own; the dead of other departments are commemorated by distant police organizations and their officers, maintaining broad, occupational assumptions of dangerous and deadly police work that transcend a single department and its localized organizational memory. Implications for the study of police culture, inequalities in policing, and police reform are considered.

## My notes

### Questions

1. Sierra-Arévalo comments at the end of his paper that incidents of police killings are at all-time lows suggesting policing culture may be resistant to change based on the changing nature and reality of their job. However, we see in some other contexts the fact that police departments have different policing styles partially dependent upon the surrounding community context and political culture. So do you agree with Sierra-Arévalo’s contention? In what ways might a community context and political culture change the reality of an officer’s job and thus change how officers reproduce the broader culture?  
      
2. [Link to 25 most dangerous professions in the USA](https://www.ishn.com/articles/112748-top-25-most-dangerous-jobs-in-the-united-states). According to at least one source, police officers have the 22nd most dangerous job in the USA and are 4.1 times more dangerous compared to the average job nationwide (as measured by deaths). Thinking about all the pieces we’ve read this week and in conjunction with any pieces we’ve read last week (emphasis on the [[mullerNorthwardMigrationRise2012]] reading), why do we think that death and danger are seemingly so much more salient within the profession of policing? They’re murders, not accidents? Does the number of deaths even matter necessarily? Culture is made. We make culture. Organizations make culture. Individuals make culture. All through social interactions. These commemorative ceremonies, memorial services, memory walls, tattoos, bracelets → These things make culture.
    
	1. Why are police so focused on the danger? Even when we have officers who have never drawn their weapon. Most officers don’t even shoot people or have been shot at. It’s because of the culture. The production of culture. Preoccupation on hostile threats and death/danger in the line of duty.

3. Sierra-Arévalo implicitly and explicitly throughout the study makes the claim that policing isn’t as dangerous as the statistics suggest. Do you agree or disagree that policing is or isn’t as dangerous as the statistics suggest? Is this the right way to go about thinking about perceived danger? (Joe’s thoughts: Are there distinctive features of the policing environment which you think would genuinely and/or reasonably heighten fear? Are there distinctive macro-level features of the USA which would heighten fear (e.g. availability of guns)?

### Introduction

Fragmentation of a monolithic police culture yet there still remains historically consistent features of the occupational culture of the police. Using ethnographic observations from three USA police departments, one consistent feature of police culture is maintained, the preoccupation with danger and death. This feature is maintained through commemorating officers killed in the line of duty using cultural artifacts. The dead officers are commemorated broadly across all police departments.

- Definition: Organizational memory → The collectively stored information of an organization’s unique history which influences individual decision-making and organizational culture. This memory is stored within and shared amongst individuals who deploy symbols, logics, and stories which reproduce the memory and culture.

**What’s the research question** → What leads to the creation of a warrior mentality among police officers? How do the deaths of police officers influence the culture of policing which in turn shapes their actions on the street?

**Why is this important** → People believe the warrior mentality among police officers leads to aggressive, enforcement-centric practices which are antithetical to democratic ideals and individuals rights.

- **Monolithic** → Consistency of culture due to common demands of policing and the organizational environment of the police.
    
- **Typological** → Heterogeneity across various police officer types/styles with officers navigating the challenges of work in their own unique way.
    
- **Filter** → Integrate macro-level features of police culture with the organizational context which shapes street-level practices. Occupational culture (broad set of norms and values) → organizational culture (local politics, management style, departmental structure) → individual police behavior. I.e. the police organization filters the occupational level culture to the individual level which affects street-level police behavior.
    
- Police culture is neither entirely monolithic nor infinitely fragmented.
    
- One drawback is that this model is unidirectional. Individual police officers cannot affect the broader culture.
    
- All this work is constrained by the limitations of survey methodologies.

### Data and Methods

Ethnographic observations and interviews across three urban police departments.

### Reesults

Policing culture actively emphasizes danger and death. Commemorative cultural artifacts (tangible, observable symbols which reflect the values and assumptions of a group) are employed by individual officers and police organizations to construct an organizational memory in which dangerous police work is emphasized (shaped by localized content and history). These artifacts are interdepartmental, and connect otherwise unrelated and dissimilar police officers to the broader idea of policing and its emphasis on death and danger.

- Death is immediately displayed in many police departments commemorating officers who died in the line of duty. Remind officers of the life-or-death nature of the job. Organizational artifacts.
    
- Individual artifacts. Individual officers also commemorate death in ways intimately tied to their unique experience and history of their department. Unlike organizational artifacts, they’re informal and not designed to be seen or displayed. E.g. tattoos, bracelets.
    
- Commemorating death and danger reflects a masculine conception of policing in which bravery is valorized as men’s work. Can reproduce assumptions of female inferiority amongst officers.
    
- Death of officers separated by time and space (sometimes great distances) are also still commemorated.
    
- Implication → Police culture is emergent and constructed by the actions of individuals situated in localized organizational contexts. Cultural stability isn’t the mechanical product of consistent pressures in police working environments. It’s influenced by the actions of police officers themselves.
    
- Discussion → Preoccupation with death leads to aggressive policing and likely fuels conflict with disadvantaged and minority communities. How are police deaths mobilized as political capital? Police suicides aren’t commemorated. Why?
    
- Reform → Optimistically officers and police organizations can play an active role in reconstructing policing culture. Police organizations and individuals are both products of and producers of police culture. Multilevel effort where an organizational environment is created that’s conducive to individual change (e.g. rewarding and expanding de-escalation training). Pessimistically policing work has never been safer suggesting policing culture is resistant to changes in the reality of their jobs. “Organizational culture eats policy for lunch.”
