## Abstract

Sociologists have given considerable attention to identifying the neighborhood-level social-interactional mechanisms that influence outcomes such as crime, educational attainment, and health. Yet, cultural mechanisms are often overlooked in quantitative studies of neighborhood effects. This paper adds a cultural dimension to neighborhood effects research by exploring the consequences of legal cynicism. Legal cynicism refers to a cultural frame in which people perceive the law as illegitimate, unresponsive, and ill equipped to ensure public safety. The authors find that legal cynicism explains why homicide persisted in certain Chicago neighborhoods during the 1990s despite declines in poverty and declines in violence citywide.

## My notes

### What is the research question?

* "Most residents of socially disadvantaged neighborhoods believe in the substance of the law and express little tolerance for violence and crime (Sampson and Bartusch 1998), yet many still engage in violations of the law despite these beliefs." (page 3 of PDF, 1191 of document). How is this possible?
* "We argue that above and beyond social structural conditions such as poverty and structural disadvantage, neighborhood levels of violence can be explained by the presence of a specific cultural frameâ€”legal cynicism." (page 3 of PDF, 1191 of document).

### Why is it important?

* [[Social disorganization]] theory was once focused on how *cultural transmission* was an essential variable in explaining why deviance persisted in disorganized neighborhoods particularly the early works theorists like [[Shaw and McKay]].
* Ignoring the cultural element leads to gaps in social disorganization theory, namely the research question.
* The hypothesized mechanism is [[Legal cynicism|legal cynicism]].
* Legal cynicism is the results of:
	* Neighborhood structural conditions
	* Neighborhood variation in policing practices and residential interactions with the police.
* Legal cynicism is a set of cultural tools developed in response to neighborhood structural conditions. It is culturally transmitted though interactions of neighborhood residents. Poor residents come to the belief/understanding that the justice system will offer them little security, and they must rely upon themselves.
* In short, residents of a neighborhood share a common economic existence. From this shared existence and interactions as well as interactions with the justice system, a culture emerges.
	* Culture does not only or even mostly operate through the setting of values and end-goals for individuals. Culture is a means of shaping how individuals perceive reality.
	* Culture is also not just an adaptation to structural conditions. It exerts an independent causal force net of structural factors.

### How do you propose to answer your question?

* Data comes from the [[PHDCN-CS]].
* A legal cynicism index is created from a variety of survey measures:
	* Laws are made to be broken.
	* Police do not do a good job in preventing crime in my neighborhood.
	* Police are not able to maintain order.
* As potentially confounding variables, they introduce *tolerance of deviance* ([[subculture of poverty]] hypothesis),  [[Collective efficacy|collective efficacy]], and neighborhood structural factors.
* Dependent variable is homicide.
* Lots of models. [[Hierarchical linear models]]; [[Poisson regression]]; [[spatial regression]].

### What do you find?

* **Table 2**: Legal cynicism is an adaptation to neighborhood structural conditions. Neighborhoods with higher concentrated disadvantage have higher legal cynicism. Test of **hypothesis 1**.
* **Hypothesis 2a**: Neighborhood-wide rates of homicide will be unrelated towards attitudes of deviance and violence (as measured by tolerance of deviance). Relates to the puzzle introduce earlier and arguments against subculture of poverty. There is not a different value system at play. **Supported in Table 3**.
* **Hypothesis 2b**: Legal cynicism will be positively associated with neighborhood rates of homicide. **Supported in Table 3**.
	* Argue that legal cynicism is more present among the youth and acts as a mediating mechanism suggesting that homicides cluster in youthful neighborhoods because youth are more cynical.
* **Hypothesis 3**: Legal cynicism is significantly and positively associated with the residual change in homicide during the 1990s net of structural changes to Chicago neighborhoods. **Supported in Table 4**.
	* Spatial lags, concentrated poverty, immigrant concentration (protective effect), proportion youth (positive relationship), collective efficacy (protective effect), and legal cynicism were all related to change in homicide rates.
	* Residential stability and tolerance of deviance were not statistically significantly related.

### Limitations

* "Yet, while we assessed whether the influence of legal cynicism explains the persistence of homicide, we did not assess whether neighborhood legal cynicism itself persists as neighborhood structural conditions are changing." (pg. 41 of PDF and 1229 of document).
