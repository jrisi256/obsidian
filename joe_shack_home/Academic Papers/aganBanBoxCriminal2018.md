## Abstract

“Ban the Box” (BTB) policies restrict employers from asking about applicants' criminal histories on job applications and are often presented as a means of reducing unemployment among black men, who disproportionately have criminal records. However, withholding information about criminal records could risk encouraging racial discrimination: employers may make assumptions about criminality based on the applicant's race. To investigate BTB's effects, we sent approximately 15,000 online job applications on behalf of fictitious young, male applicants to employers in New Jersey and New York City before and after the adoption of BTB policies. These applications varied whether the applicant had a distinctly black or distinctly white name and the felony conviction status of the applicant. We confirm that criminal records are a major barrier to employment: employers that asked about criminal records were 63% more likely to call applicants with no record. However, our results support the concern that BTB policies encourage racial discrimination: the black-white gap in callbacks grew dramatically at companies that removed the box after the policy went into effect. Before BTB, white applicants to employers with the box received 7% more callbacks than similar black applicants, but BTB increased this gap to 43%. We believe that the best interpretation of these results is that employers are relying on exaggerated impressions of real-world racial differences in felony conviction rates.

## Findings overview from the Introduction

* Applicants without convictions were 5.2 percentage points more likely to be called back than those without convictions (8.2 vs. 13.4).
* The Black-White gap in callbacks after ban the box was implemented grew by 4 percentage points.
	* Black applicants without criminal records saw a substantial drop in callback rates.
	* White applicants with criminal records saw a substantial increase in callback rates.
* Economic modeling implies that employers are relying upon greatly exaggerated priors about racial differences in felony conviction rates.

## Study

* Submitted online job applications for low-skill, entry-level jobs before and after ban-the-box went into effect in New Jersey and New York City from 2015 to 2016.
  
* **Dependent variable** -> Did an applicant receive a callback? Tracked for up to 8 weeks from the application date.
  
* Applicant profiles -> male, ages 21 - 22, two prior jobs, high school or GED, felony conviction status (either property crimes such as shoplifting or fairly minor drug crimes), and information about the criminal charge. Applications were created in pairs of one Black and one White applicant (signaled using names) which were assigned to the same business in the same time period.
	* Criminal conviction, one-year/two-month/no employment gap between past two jobs, GED/high school diploma were all randomized.
	  
* Submitted 15,220 applications and used 14,637 of them.
  
* Regression results indicate Whites received more callbacks and those with a conviction received less callbacks.
