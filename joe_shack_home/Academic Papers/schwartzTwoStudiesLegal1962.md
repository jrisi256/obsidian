## Notes

They conducted two studies:

1. They had four experimental conditions where they showed potential employers one of four envelopes with employment history information for an unskilled hotel job in the Catskills. The individual either: 1) had no criminal history, 2) a criminal record but was acquitted with a note from the judge, 3) a criminal record but was acquitted, 4) a criminal record. Results were as one would expect. The more severe seeming the mark of the criminal record, the less likely an individual was to hire them.
	1. Each experimental arm had only 25 subjects.
	   
2. The second study surveyed doctors accused of medical malpractice. They found doctors accused of medical practice (most were found not guilty) did not suffer much in the way of their practice i.e., they continued to receive clients.

 In the end, they conclude by discussing the interpretation of their results and why they found conflicting results (e.g., doctors are in short supply, stronger institutional protections and ties, patients may not have known about the accusations, comparing a criminal record to medical malpractice is not an apt comparison).
