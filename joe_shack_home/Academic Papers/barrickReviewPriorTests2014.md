## Abstract

Ascending to popularity in the 1960s, labeling theory shifted the focus of criminological theory away from the offender. Labeling theorists argued that initial delinquency is normal and occurs for a variety of reasons, but official reactions to it may lead to future offending. For the first time in almost 200 years, the legal system itself became an object of inquiry and researchers began examining the societal reaction to deviance. This represented a marked shift from mainstream sociological thought at the time. Generally, labeling theorists proposed that publicly defining and treating an individual as a deviant may result in exclusions from conventional society, a possible identity change, and an increase in the likelihood of subsequent deviance. Labelists also argued that extralegal characteristics, such as race and class, influence whether official intervention will be imposed.

## My notes

### Introduction

During the 1980’s many critics of [[labeling theory]] pronounced it dead. It lacked theoretical specificity and empirical support. Failed to explain/consider the actual processes which lead to labels being produced leading to secondary deviance. Others didn’t think the perspective was dead just under-theorized as as a result the empirical work was lacking.

### Findings

Labeling hypothesis receives more support when reviewing the 66 studies than its rival hypothesis, [[Deterrence theory]]. It should be noted most of the research was inconclusive (no statistically significant findings) though. Of the research which was statistically significant, it was majority positive. Digging in:

- When controlling for prior criminal history, support for labeling becomes decidedly mixed. Too much heterogeneity on how prior history gets operationalized.

- Looking at studies with larger sample sizes produces stronger evidence for labeling.

- Studies which used a longer follow-up period to track recidivism found moderately more support for labeling.

- There’s heterogeneity in how recidivism is measured too. Studies which use self-report data find very strong support for labeling. Arrests and convictions provide mixed results.

- Using a variety of contexts to find the strongest studies, they basically find the stronger the study the more support it provides for the labeling hypothesis.

- Juveniles appear to conform much more to the predictions of the labeling hypothesis vs. adults.

- No offense type provided yielded a majority of findings in support of labeling theory. However, strongest support was found for violent offenses and property offenses. Domestic violence cases found much stronger support for specific deterrence.

### Future Research

More research needs to be done to understand the full process through labeling takes effect (alters one’s identity, limits one’s structural opportunities, impacts one’s peer associations).  

More research also needs to be done concerning how personal and demographic characteristics come to bear on the strength or weakness of a label. Mixed evidence as to whether labeling has more of an effect for minorities and lower classes. Competing views as to how stakes in conformity will affect labeling (some say it makes you more vulnerable, others say no).

Under-theorized in particular has been the relationship between sex and labeling. Those who are more risk averse may be more susceptible to specific deterrence vs. labeling. Since it’s hypothesized that females are more risk averse, they may be less susceptible to labeling.
