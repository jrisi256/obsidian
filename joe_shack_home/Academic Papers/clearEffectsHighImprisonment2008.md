## Abstract

When large numbers of parent-aged adults, especially men, cycle through stays in prison and jail at very high rates, communities are negatively affected in myriad ways, including damage to social networks, social relationships, and long-term life chances. These effects impair children, family functioning, mental and physical health, labor markets, and economic and political infrastructures. There are considerable methodological challenges in trying to link the consequences of concentrated incarceration to reduced public safety. Findings from studies are mixed. Yet, as empirical evidence grows of the negative collateral consequences of concentrated incarceration, the likelihood that concentrated incarceration is criminogenic in its effects on those communities becomes stronger. No well-established or proven strategy exists for combating the effects of concentrated incarceration on communities. Most current debates about penal policy are essentially oblivious to the problem. Solutions must flow from changes in the nation's penal philosophy and its sentencing laws.

## How does incarceration affect public safety?

- The public safety effects of increased incarceration are unknown and likely to be a mixed bag and not be linear or additive. We know from [[naginDeterrenceTwentyFirstCentury2013]], [[durlaufImprisonmentCrime2011]], [[loefflerDoesImprisonmentAlter2013]], [[loefflerImpactIncarcerationRecidivism2022]] that incarceration is likely, if anything, criminogenic as most of its crime reduction capacity comes from incapacitation. Certainly, not deterrent.

## Organizing claims

1. Mass incarceration is concentrated in poor communities of color.
	1. It is mostly: *men*, *under the age of 40*, *Black*, *who have not finished high school*. Extreme segregation in the US means incarceration also concentrates in place.
2. These communities are negatively affected by the concentration of incarceration.
3. These negative effects likely decrease public safety more than incarceration increases it.
4. Penal philosophy and sentencing policy must change.
    
## Mechanisms

- See [[bramanDoingTimeOutside2004]], [[christianRidingBusBarriers2005]], [[christianSocialEconomicImplications2006]]. Individuals being incarcerated strains the resources of their families. Families have to deal with court costs, supporting the incarcerated individual (both through visiting them and post-release), and strains parenting. #papers_to_read 
  
- The social networks for poorer individuals tend to be dominated by strong ties and not weak ties (who are more important for building social capital and bridging social networks allowing for the exchange of goods and services hard to find in one's own network).
	- When individuals are incarcerated, the strong tie is either severed or considerable cost goes into maintaining it.
	- More generally young men are inhibited from forming social networks across other communities enabling the flow of resources into their communities. Young men typically are meant to be in the labor market, meeting new people, creating weak ties, and expanding the social capital capacity for those in their social circle. **This opportunity is lost**.
	  
- Social networks are the foundation of informal social control --> [[hunterPrivateParochialPublic1985]]. See [[browningIlluminatingDownsideSocial2009]] --> the type of network is important for how its crime controlling aspects operate. Social networks dominated by strong ties tend to have weaker crime controlling properties.
    
- Incarceration harms [[Collective efficacy|collective efficacy]] as individuals who are incarcerated and their families tend to isolate themselves undermining norms of cooperation and social support. This process can also increase [[Legal cynicism|legal cynicism]].
    
- Methodological problem → many network and community level forces exerting pressure in multiple directions both receiving the effects of incarceration and producing changes in rates of incarceration. #methods_issue #paper_idea 
	- “In the search for a more finely tuned understanding of exactly what causes what and by how much, it is important not to lose sight of the bigger picture. When communities suffer these ill effects, children are more likely to become delinquent and incarceration, at high levels, can become a self-sustaining system.” → Death by a thousand little cuts. #quote 

## Children

* [[murrayEffectsParentalImprisonment2008]] --> parental incarceration makes their children more likely to become involved with crime, develop a serious mental health disorder, experience difficulties with school, and become involved with illegal drug usage.
* Methodological problems → “These studies do not necessarily demonstrate that incarceration causes these problematic child outcomes. Indeed, the evidence that Murray and Farrington provide from controlled experiments on this issue is mixed, with some studies indicating that preexisting risks may account for at least some of the consequences of parental incarceration.” #methods_issue 
    
## Families

* Leads to the deterioration of *poor* American families. It literally breaks up families, creates single-parent households, leads to families moving in together to preserve resources (overcrowding), reduces the changes of marriage, and increased residential mobility.
* Affects parenting and family functioning. In particular, families losing the male's income is particularly devastating.
* Changes to the male/female ratio lead to increases in sexual disease transmission and increases in teenage pregnancy. See [[thomasIncarcerationForcedMigration2008]] and [[thomasIncarcerationSexuallyTransmitted2008]].

## Economic Infrastructure

- People who become incarcerated already had poor work records. Incarceration worsens their already poor prospects for finding meaningful, gainful employment. Disrupts local labor markets as well → more money leaving the community and less money being spent/produced in the community. Incarcerated men pumped money into the local economy, supporting families, spending money, sometimes working. See [[venkateshSocialOrganizationStreet1997]] and [[faganCrimeWork1999]].

## Other effects

- [[Legal cynicism]].
- Voting.

## Coercive mobility

* [[roseIncarcerationSocialCapital1998]] and [[clearCoerciveMobilityCrime2003]].
- Public safety and crime → coercive mobility. Removal of young residents for imprisonment weakens attachment to the neighborhood and erodes collective efficacy. Mechanisms for exercising informal social control are dampened. Additionally, these poor communities must now absorb large numbers of returning individuals from jail/prison. These communities tend to have higher crime rates because these individuals are more crime prone plus they are more resource needy while these resource-deprived communities cannot adequately help these men.
- Tipping point where the worst effects of coercive mobility take effect after a large number of people are caught up in prison cycling.
- Replications largely replicate the results from the original 2003 study. Except for one study (Bhati, Lynch, and Sabol 2005) which used an instrument. Drug arrests is the instrument (correlated with incarceration and independent of crime since there is a nearly inexhaustible supply of potential people to arrest) → The instrument indicates that higher rates of incarceration lead to less crime (on net since they do find it has also some negative impacts on informal social control). Clear is not very confident in this choice of variable as an instrument. How generalizable are these results? For which neighborhoods does the instrument induce a change in the incarceration rate?

## Methodological issues

- [[simultaneity bias]] → Crime causes incarceration and vice versa. Usual solution is time-ordered data to model the reciprocal effect [[Structural equation modeling]]?
- [[omitted variable bias]] or [[endogeneity]] → Crime and incarceration are being caused by some unknown third variable. E.g., crime and incarceration are really downstream effects of something like concentrated disadvantage. Can include more controls or use an [[instrumental variable]].
- One Solution? → effect of adult incarceration on juvenile crime. High rates of adult incarceration would lead to more juvenile crime (weakened supervision) but increases in juvenile delinquency should not increase adult incarceration. Free of issues of simultaneity.
- Clear argues the weight of the evidence points to the fact that incarceration, itself, is problematic.
## Research goals

* Longitudinal study of a large sample of neighborhoods will help sort out modeling problems. Use of multiple outcome measures. Patterns of incarceration will allow for more sensitive modeling of the reciprocal effects of incarceration rates on crime and allow for a teasing out of the positive and negative effects.

- Linked to family and social network data, we can understand how incarceration affects network and family-level outcomes.
    
- Individual-level data about the people being removed and returned (especially their criminal history) to see if effects of incarceration are mediated by different types of arrest patterns and different types of people being incarcerated. #paper_idea
