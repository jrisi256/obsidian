## Abstract

This article examines the intersection of two structural developments: the growth of surveillance and the rise of “big data.” Drawing on observations and interviews conducted within the Los Angeles Police Department, I offer an empirical account of how the adoption of big data analytics does—and does not—transform police surveillance practices. I argue that the adoption of big data analytics facilitates amplifications of prior surveillance practices and fundamental transformations in surveillance activities. First, discretionary assessments of risk are supplemented and quantified using risk scores. Second, data are used for predictive, rather than reactive or explanatory, purposes. Third, the proliferation of automatic alert systems makes it possible to systematically surveil an unprecedentedly large number of people. Fourth, the threshold for inclusion in law enforcement databases is lower, now including individuals who have not had direct police contact. Fifth, previously separate data systems are merged, facilitating the spread of surveillance into a wide range of institutions. Based on these findings, I develop a theoretical model of big data surveillance that can be applied to institutional domains beyond the criminal justice system. Finally, I highlight the social consequences of big data surveillance for law and social inequality.

## My notes

### Research question

* How has the adoption of big data analytics transformed police surveillance practices?
  
* What are the implications of new surveillance practices afforded by big data on the law, social inequality, and big data practices in other institutions?
  
* Will it serve as a rationalizing force to reduce bias, increase efficiency, and improve predictions? Or will it reify bias and deepen existing patterns of inequality?

### History

* The use of data in decision-making within the criminal justice system is not new. In 1928, Ernest Burgess of the Chicago School designed an actuarial model to predict the probability of a parolee reoffending.
  
* [[Sentencing guidelines]].
  
* The move toward actuarial justice as more and more aspects of the courts incorporate criminal riskiness into their decision inputs.
  
* Data-driving decision making has only become systematically incorporated into law enforcement practices in recent decades as opposed to other aspects of the criminal justice system which have been incorporating data-driven practices for nearly a decade now.
  
	* Reactive policing was seen to be largely ineffective. [[hot spots policing]] and [[CompStat]].

### Methods

* Draws on interview and observational fieldwork data collected over 2.5 years with the LAPD. Observed how data was used in ride-alongs and in helicopters. Shadowed analysts as they worked with data. Also attended big data conferences geared towards the police. Also did some archival work on law enforcement training manuals and surveillance industry literature.
  
* Interviewed 75 people and followed up with 31 people. Interviewed people at a variety of ranks. Exploited different adoption time intervals within and between divisions since not all divisions adopted big data analytic practices at the same time. Considerable variation in whether and when big tech was adopted.
  
	* Allowed for interviewing of individuals who were not using predictive policing vs. those who were vs. those who were not and then eventually did.
	  
* Chose LA because it is at the forefront of using data to analyze crime.
  
	* Transparency and accountability. Consent decree entered into following the Rodney King beating.
	  
	* California, in an attempt to reduce prison populations, shifted responsibility for supervising some released offenders to local law enforcement. LAPD turned to risk modeling as a means of using resources more efficiently.

### Results

Policing, as a result, has become more predictive and based on the idea of preemptive intervention rather than being reactive and only becoming involved once a criminal action has been reported.

* Supreme Court decisions allowing for pretextual stops catalyzed this process.

Policing practices are changed in the following 5 ways starting with those changes which are smallest and ending with those changes which are biggest:

1. Discretionary assessments of risk are supplemented and quantified using risk scores.
	1. Individuals seen as being risky are stopped by the police more leading to higher future risk scores (since being stopped by the police can contribute to one's risk).
	2. These do not even have to be *formal* (if such a thing exists) stop and frisks.
	3. Signal to individuals they are being watched to hopefully deter crime. Goes to the above point which is that law enforcement are becoming increasingly predictive and proactive.
 
2. Data are increasingly used for predictive, rather than reactive or explanatory, purposes.
   
	1. Based on the [[PredPol]] algorithm which assumes that crime in one area heightens the risk of crime in surrounding areas, officers are given 500 by 500 square foot boxes overlaying their patrol area and are encouraged to spend in time in the riskiest boxes.
	   
	2. Some patrol officers said the algorithm is not adding anything new to what they already knew -> worried about being replaced or deskilled -> also worried it would remain for surveillance of themselves. But the author found it still informed their practice.

3. The proliferation of automated alerts makes it possible to systematically surveil an unprecedentedly large number of people.
   
	1. Before police officers would need to manually query things themselves. Now, the officers can tell the database to alert them when certain conditions are met.
	   
	2. Additionally, police queries (used even before big data) were increasingly being used as inputs into analysis as well. Letting officers know what other officers made similar queries, how many times an individual has been queried (proxy for risk). 

4. Datasets now include information on individuals who have not had any direct police contact.
   
	1. Made possible through network analysis.
	2. Automatic license plate readers.
	3. Creates a working reserve of data that can be used in the future for capturing criminals.
   
5. Previously separate data systems are merged into relational systems and include data collected in other, non-criminal justice institutions.

	1. Create a person-level index which would track all of their interactions with law enforcement, social services, health services, and child and family services -> also merged with public data from social media, foreclosure, electronic toll pass data, address and utility usage, parking lot, call data from pizza chains, etc.
	   
	2. Often times it was the industry and the companies introducing these features which helped create the demand on the part of law enforcement.

Author argues it has yet to be determined if data-driven policing will make policing better and more transparent. However, the author argues it is already reproducing inequality:

1. Deepens surveillance of individuals already under suspicion under the guise of objectivity.
	1. "Predictive models are performative, creating a feedback loop in which they not only predict events such as crime or police contact, but also contribute to their future occurrence." #highlight #quote #paper_idea 
	   
2. Widens the criminal justice dragnet unequally.
	1. Allows us to see how [[cumulative disadvantage]] develops as people are differentially fed into the models as data. 
   
3. Leads people to avoid *surveilling institutions* which are important for social integration. [[labeling theory]].

Police are not intentionally using big data maliciously. Discrimination is an artifact of the data collection and analysis process itself. Algorithmic decision procedures can reproduce existing patterns of discrimination.

Need to understand each step of data collection and data analysis to understand how data systems inherit the bias of their creators and users which may be latent.

### Law implications

* Strengthen privacy laws which typically only control data the point of collection. Must protect from function creep. Must regulate private data usage and selling.

* Need to redefine what search and seizure mean.

### Big data studies

* Why was big data surveillance adopted? What are the organization's goals?
  
	* Performative and cultural (e.g., denotes seriousness if your organization is using data) or efficient and practical?
	* For police, it is to categorize people according to criminal risk. For credit card companies, it is to identify people as financial risks or as good future customers.
	* People argue the organizational imperative for surveillance is social sorting.
	  
* How is big data surveillance conducted?
  
* What actions are taken based on big data surveillance and what are its consequences?
	* Can deepen inequality by subjecting the vulnerable to harmful surveillance and the advantaged to beneficial surveillance.
