## Abstract

A reanalysis of self-reported delinquency data from the Richmond Youth Survey indicates that [[social control theory]] has only limited explanatory power. The analysis confirms a prediction of [[anomie|strain theory]], although strain theory, too, has limited explanatory power. The impact of Hirschi's Causes of Delinquency may have been due as much to its ideological appeal as to the strength of the evidence that it presented in support of social control theory.

## My notes

### Questioning the findings

* The weakest part of Hirschi’s theory (acknowledged elsewhere too) is the involvement part. Time spent on hobbies, working around the house, watching TV/reading have little impact on delinquent activities. Many of Hirschi’s other tables do show relationships in line with what the theory would predict.  

- **Attachment to parents** -> Intimacy of communication with father. 38% of those who have the least intimate communication w/ father report no delinquent acts, 73% of those who have most intimate communication w/ father report no delinquent acts.
	- Yet because relatively few members of the sample lie at these extreme ends, hardly any of the variance in delinquency is explained. Suggests intimacy of communication, at best, has a weak influence on involvement in delinquency.
	- Similar findings for emotional identification with father (those sons who most want to be like their father will have less delinquency).
	- Same for concern for teacher’s opinion.
	- Basically, Hirschi did not use regression and did not take into account the sample sizes.
    
- **Commitment to Education** -> In general, in contrast to anomie theory, find that the higher one’s college aspirations, the more likely one is to not be delinquent (for fear of risking the attachment and concomitant benefits).
	- However we need to compare expectations to aspirations. We do find that expectations below aspirations increase delinquency rates (which is indicative of more strain).
	- Greenberg clusters the data a bit differently from Hirschi (examines strain within categories of aspiration). Finds Hirschi was wrong “Contrary to Hirschi, within categories of aspiration, the higher the level of strain, the higher the delinquency.” However, as predicted by social control, those whose aspirations are lower tend to have higher involvement in delinquency.  #quote 

### Conclusion

* Findings generally consistent with control theory’s predictions, but you also cannot rule out alternative explanations.
	* “... find support for control theory, but the support is not as strong as Hirschi believes. If one considers the goal of theory to be the explanation of variation in outcomes, the results cannot be described as an unqualified victory for control theory.” #quote 
	  
* Very strange that Hirschi’s new theory of self-control finds social control theory’s findings spurious.
  
* Why isn't social control stronger?
	* Measurement error.
	* Summary measures dilute the findings.
	* Temporal mis-specification (cross-sectional data, effects play out over a time period, yet Hirschi was using present-day bonding levels to predict past delinquency) -> Subsequent work finds using longitudinal data doesn’t help too much.
	* Maybe social control theory is just weak. It only has a modest effect in explaining variation.
	* What else can contribute? Greenberg points to strain/anomie theory (despite Hirschi’s writings, it isn’t disproven by his data). Neither is differential association.
	* There may be some value, then, in attempting to integrate these different theories, would’ve greater explanatory power than any of them alone. However such synthesis only makes sense if they aren’t logically incompatible. “Strain and social control theories are special cases of a more general utility-maximizing model of criminality.” Control theory focuses on costs of crimes, strain theory on benefits. #quote 
	  
* Why wasn’t this done sooner? Conservative political landscape in the USA comports with social control’s pessimistic view of man? -> Political unrest thought to result from weakening of social control institutions? While useful, has led to neglect of other theoretical traditions.
	* Why do some juveniles have less attachment to legitimate persons and institutions? If Hirschi asked this, he may have found out that it is likely due to social learning and [[Social disorganization|social disorganization]].
