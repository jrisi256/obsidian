## Abstract

We examine the deterrent effect of arrest in incidents of spouse abuse. The data are from field experiments conducted in four cities--Milwaukee, Omaha, Dade County (Florida), and Colorado Springs. On the average, arrest is no more effective than other police interventions in reducing new incidents of violence. However, arrest has differential effects on subsequent violence depending on the background of the offender. The implications of the findings for social science theory and public policy are discussed.

## My notes

### Introduction

* In 1989, the Minneapolis Police Department ran an experiment -> in response to misdemeanor domestic violence cases, they would either 1) arrest the offender, 2) order the suspect away from the house for 24 hours, or 3) try to restore order. They found arresting the offender led to the lowest likelihood of future violence.
	* Interesting moderating effects found where individuals with less attachment to the community and less subject to informal social control became more violent in response to arrest (see [[Social control theory|social control]] and [[labeling theory]]).

### Data and methods

* Analyze data from 4 replication sites (Milwaukee, Omaha, Dade County Florida, and Colorado Springs).
  
* Was the moderation effect detected in the introduction the result of omitted variable bias? Some third variable is causing lower attachment and higher likelihood of more violence? Hard to deal with -> argue from theory, run diagnostics to see how large of an effect would have to nullify your results, temper your conclusions.
  
* Was the moderation effect the result of exploratory research? We can address this through replication and/or test + train.
  
* Use [[Bayesian estimation]] procedures to estimate the effects of the intervention for standard error purposes. **Very different interpretation from frequentist analyses**, though. Since conventional statistical significance testing would find null results for all variables. See footnote 9.
  
* Use [[Logistic regression]] for modeling purposes (follow-up incident? 1/0). 

* Specific to Colorado Springs, follow-up data comes from police records and interviews with victims. 6 month follow-up. 

### Findings

* In general, doing something was better than doing nothing (where doing nothing was *restoring order*). Perhaps the key component was emergency protection orders. However, when estimated individually (for Colorado Springs), each of the treatment arms had a negative association with future violence but none of the terms were precise.
  
* Arrests in Colorado Springs had no association with future violence for those who are unemployed and not married **big point** -> social control theory does not pan out, sort of.
	* Arrests have differential effects depending on a person's attachment and thus susceptibility to social control (as measured by employment and marital status).
	* Being employed and arrested seemed to lower one's propensity for committing a future violent domestic abuse act (only in the pooled sample).
		* Those who are employed but not arrested had higher likelihoods of future violence -> **Troubling because you would think employment should reduce the likelihood**.
	* Being married and arrested seemed to have positive associations with future violent domestic abuse acts (imprecise). Conversely (?) those who are married but not arrested had lower likelihoods of future violence.
		* **Weird because you would expect marriage to always reduce the likelihood of future violence**.
	* **Thus arrests seem to have the most deterrent effect on those who are employed**.
	* Perplexing results:
		* Marriage and employment are in different directions.
		* Marriage and employment have different effects depending on if one is arrested or not.
		  
* **Social control theory does not come looking well in this analysis.**
  
* In the pooled sample across all 4 sites, arrests were associated with more violence.
	* Changes in the results are likely due to the fact that experiment participants were not randomly chosen. Generalizability of these experiments is severely hampered by this fact.
	* E.g., a strong deterrent effect, on average, might have been found if more employed people were arrested. But this does not mean arrests are, on average in a different sample, in the general population, etc., deterrent.

* Results vary pretty widely depending on how you parameterize the variables and what functional form you specify.
	* Are employment and marriage just measures of social control? Likely not.
	* Omitted variable bias for interaction effects.
	* The authors, thus, do not think any theoretical explanation of the variables from the social control or labeling tradition can shed any light on the findings here.
	* Chalk up the findings to [[Deterrence theory]] that employed persons are likely good options for people to arrest. Unemployed persons are less good options for people to arrest.
	* **There are no policy implications which can be drawn from the study except to say that arrests (depending on the person) does not always lead to a beneficial outcome.** -> However, the authors also do not suggest that their results provide evidence for abandoning arrests as a policy, either.
		* Also, how can we operationalize the findings if we took them at face value? Should we really only arrest employed people? Would that stand up in court? How do you determine if someone is actually employed?
