## Abstract

Historically speaking, criminological theory tends to pay great attention to identifying the various sources of criminal motivation while downplaying the opportunity to carry out crime in particular situations. However, perspectives that address situational opportunity have gained tremendous traction in the field over the past several decades to the point that there is now a substantial body of theory and research on the issue. This article reviews such theory and research within the context of four overlapping yet distinct lines of inquiry. First, we review scholarship that uses situational opportunity to understand individual victimization. Second, we discuss theory and research that link situational opportunity and high-crime places. Third, we explore scholarship that embraces a multicontextual opportunity perspective to understand crime and victimization events within neighborhood contexts. Fourth, we examine work that integrates situational opportunity into explanations of offending.

## My notes

### Opportunity and individual victimization

When [[Routine activity]] theory was first posited by [[cohenSocialChangeCrime1979]], it was meant to apply at a macro-level to help explain temporal trends in national rates of crime.
  
At the same time, lifestyle-exposure theory was being developed concerning the differential levels of risk of victimization experienced by different individuals. Both rest on the idea that lifestyles and routine activities create opportunities for crime and victimization.
  
Studies around this time confirmed many of the core tenets of the theory -> engaging in riskier activities or taking more precautionary steps to protect one's property were associated, respectively, with higher or lower likelihoods of being victimized.
	* Among adolescents, being involved in delinquent activities greatly increases one risk of becoming a victim.

One's propensity for becoming a victim was likely connected to low self control (see [[gottfredsonGeneralTheoryCrime1990]]). Generally speaking, low self control would likely have indirect effects on victimization as one would make poor lifestyle decisions making it more likely that they would be victimized. See [[prattSelfControlVictimizationMetaAnalysis2014]].

### Criminology of Place

See [[shermanHotSpotsPredatory1989]] -> crime is concentrated in specific places. Why does crime concentrate in specific places?

#### Crime Pattern Theory

Reasoning offenders look to cues about crime opportunity in the physical and social environments in which they carry out their daily routines. Assumes offenders make patterned reasoned decisions about where to offend and whom to offend -> decisions are based on what the offender is familiar with i.e., locations found within their daily routines.

#### Environmental Design Theory

The degree to which site layout and design features enable **access control** (regulating the movements of people into and out of as well within an area), **target hardening** (the extent to which access to targets is limited to those for legitimate uses), and **surveillance** (ability for individuals in an area to be seen).

#### Place Management Theory

Evidence of crime hot spots indicates that the convergence of motivated offenders, suitable targets, and a lack of capable guardians does not happen randomly. Specifically, why does crime happen in some places in disadvantaged areas but not others? Theorists expand the category of **guardians** to also include what they call **managers** or individuals responsible for monitoring and controlling behavior in a certain place. Evidence points to the fact that the more involved a manager, the more likely it is that crime will not develop in that place.

### Interaction of Routine Activities and Neighborhood Context

Individuals or places are nested within broader environmental units which can also be characterized by their criminal opportunities. Thus, crime opportunity is structured at multiple, embedded units of analysis. Opportunity emerges from the interactions between various levels of analysis.

#### Situational Opportunity and Offending

* Unstructured socializing among adolescents.

* **Situational action theory** -> Criminogenic settings are not criminogenic for all young people. Some research has found that time spent in unstructured socializing was related to heightened delinquency but not for youth with low criminal propensity. Crime is chosen as a viable course of action when someone with a high level of crime propensity encounters a criminally encouraging context. Propensity is linked to individual morality and self-control. Propensity interacts with and depends on environmental factors and opportunities, though. Both are necessary and neither, alone, are sufficient.
	* Control (both external and internal) is important in situations of non-correspondence i.e., a person with low propensity is in a high risk environment or vice versa.
	* This theory goes slightly against [[haynieReconsideringPeersDelinquency2005]]. #theory_challenge .
