## Abstract

This paper assesses and synthesizes the cumulative results of a new “neighborhood-effects” literature that examines social processes related to problem behaviors and health-related outcomes. Our review identified over 40 relevant studies published in peer-reviewed journals from the mid-1990s to 2001, the take-off point for an increasing level of interest in neighborhood effects. Moving beyond traditional characteristics such as concentrated poverty, we evaluate the salience of social-interactional and institutional mechanisms hypothesized to account for neighborhood-level variations in a variety of phenomena (e.g., delinquency, violence, depression, high-risk behavior), especially among adolescents. We highlight neighborhood ties, social control, mutual trust, institutional resources, disorder, and routine activity patterns. We also discuss a set of thorny methodological problems that plague the study of neighborhood effects, with special attention to selection bias. We conclude with promising strategies and directions for future research, including experimental designs, taking spatial and temporal dynamics seriously, systematic observational approaches, and benchmark data on neighborhood social processes.

## Highlighted Notes

### Question

* Through what mechanisms does concentrated poverty lead to crime?
	* [[Social control theory|Social control]]
	* Mutual trust
	* Institutional resources
	* Disorder
	* [[Routine activity]] patterns
* Other factors focused on understanding why neighborhoods differ on crime outcomes include [[residential instability]], [[home ownership]], [[population density]], and [[ethnic heterogeneity]]. Nothing has been as consistent as concentrated disadvantage. **Especially population density and ethnic heterogeneity**.

### Review findings

* Problems tend to be bundled (health, crime, education)
* Common predictors are [[Concentrated disadvantage|concentrated disadvantage]], [[racial segregation]], single-parent families, and rates/length of home ownership.
* Robust for different measurements of place.
* Intense segregation appears to be increasing (at both lower and upper spectrum).

### What we have found

* Lots of people are using surveys to measure latent properties of communities. We need to get as good as the psychometric people in our measurements and developing [[Ecometrics|ecometrics]].
* What are the neighborhood mechanisms, *specifically*, leading to [[crime]]? Related to the points in the introduction and abstract.
	* [[Social ties]]/Interaction + [[social capital]].
		* It's not just about strong ties but also your weak ties. Too many strong ties or too dense of a social network may be detrimental as well.
	* Norms and collective efficacy. Willingness to intervene, informal surveillance and monitoring of teenage peer groups.
	* Institutional Resources. Things like libraries, schools, child care, medical facilities.
	* Routine activities. How land use patterns behavior and how the ecological distribution of routine activities bear on children's well-being. Locations of schools, how close are commercial activities.
	* Points 3 and 4 have been hard to measure.
* These social mechanisms are also tied to neighborhood health measures.
* Traditional measures still matter, of course (e.g., concentrated disadvantage). These variables have direct causal links and many times the mediating mechanisms only come about in affluent socioeconomic conditions.
* [[Broken windows hypothesis]] isn't so clear-cut. Is disorder a cause of crime? A separate outcome correlated with crime?

### Methodological Challenges

* Selection bias and experiments.
	* #causal_inference_skeptical 
	* They are important for separating out *neighborhood effects* from the selection effects of people leaving and entering the neighborhood.
	* Experiments are not useful for helping us understand the mechanisms behind neighborhood effects.
	* Useful for establishing those effects in the first place.
	* It is also important to understand selection mechanisms and not just control away for them.
	* This seems like it is an issue of [[generalizability]]. Who will the results of the experiment generalize or speak to? How might others who use different selection criteria experience different outcomes?
* Over-controlling
	* Sometimes we will accidentally control for a mechanism through which neighborhood effects are operating.
* Event-based models
	* We only look at where individuals live and not where they spend their time.

### New Directions

* Better define neighborhood boundaries to be more consistent with how people actually view them or how people can use them.
* Conduct systematic social observation to record physical and social properties of the neighborhood. Combine social observation with surveys.
* Take into account spatial interdependence of neighborhoods. I.e. how do similarly situated neighborhoods but for different types of adjacent neighborhoods fare?
* Analyze the dynamics of change in neighborhoods. Longitudinal data.
* Collect benchmark data on neighborhood social processes and ecometric data to allow researchers and community members to better understand the health of their community. And allow for more cross-neighborhood comparison.
