## Abstract

Research on inequality in punishment has a long and storied history, yet the overwhelming focus has been on episodic disparity in isolated stages of criminal case processing (e.g., arrest, prosecution, or sentencing). Although theories of [[cumulative disadvantage]] exist in criminology, they are seldom adapted to account for treatment in the criminal justice system. We provide an overview of the concept of cumulative disadvantage in the life course and review evidence on the development of cumulative disadvantages across stages of the criminal justice system. In doing so, we appraise the empirical research on policing, prosecution, and the courts and consider how these largely separate bodies of scholarship are inherently connected. We conclude with a call for future research that focuses more explicitly on the ways that life-course disadvantages shape contact with the criminal justice system and how these processes work to perpetuate patterns of disadvantage within the system and in subsequent life outcomes.

## My notes

### Introduction to the idea of cumulative disadvantage

* Cumulative disadvantage is the process which encompasses the cumulative impact of a specific disadvantage over time and/or the accumulation of multiple, interactive forms of disadvantage both within and across time points.
  
* This core notion in the social sciences has yet to be applied in a serious, theoretical way within the criminal justice system.

	* **Approach 1** -> Temporal growth in inequalities which magnify pre-existing differences between individuals or groups. Different from inequality because it grows exponentially over time and compounds becoming harder and harder to combat over time -> longitudinal data.
	  
	* **Approach 2** -> Cumulative disadvantage is an additive and interactional process. It reflects the persistent direct and indirect effects that status variables exert over the [[Life course theory|life-course]] -> emphasis is on static group differences rather than on pathways of growth in advantage over time.
		* Race/ethnicity is intimately tied to other factors like health, nutrition, family structure, education, etc.
		* Mediation and moderation analysis.

* Theoretically, cumulative disadvantage can be found in the works of [[labeling theory]] and life-course theorists.
	* See [[Secondary Deviance]] -> accumulation of stigmatizing labels.
	* See life-course theory -> individuals start life with differing socio-structural characteristics which lead to disparities in the likelihood of committing deviant acts and then experiencing contact with the CJ system.
	* We already know individuals with many pre-existing disadvantages are more likely to experience contact with the CJ system.
		* Race and school discipline.

### How does cumulative disadvantage accumulate across the CJ system?

* Need research on how earlier decisions shape later outcomes, how minor inequities can accumulate over time, how individual disparities are moderated by other case and defendant characteristics, and how inequities can be built into the CJ system. Borrowing from the ideas on transitions and trajectories.
  
* Previous research has tended to focus on the decision-making processes of individual system actors or how broader societal forces shape punishment.

	* Not enough work has been done on how inequalities can accumulate through multiple stages of decision making. Disparities arising in one stage can appear in another and even grow. Earlier decisions can act as signals to downstream actors -> expectations of the behavior of other system actors can also shape case-processing (e.g., is the judge lenient, prosecutor will not charge these crimes, etc.).

	* Statistical models needed to capture the joint and interactive effects of defendant characteristics across sequential outcomes and influences across different stages of the CJ system leading to accumulation of disadvantage.

	* Criminal justice actors may share similar assessments of danger and culpability grounded in shared stereotypes and knowledge.
	  
	* Cumulative disadvantage can also reflect systemic bias in criminal justice policy rather than the behavior of individual actors.
		* Everyday discretion invoked by criminal justice system actors.
		* Legislators and policy makers who establish the formal legal rules which guide actors in the criminal justice system.

#### Police contact

* Police discretion shaped by class, race, and place.
* More responsive to certain types of victims.
* Different individuals have different likelihoods of coming into contact with the police.
	* [[hot spots policing]] -> minority over-representation in drug arrests at least partially reflects the differential targeting of outdoor drug markets by police.
* Police discretion shapes arrest record and criminal history.

#### Charging decisions

* Prosecutors have enormous power to set the terms by deciding what they want to charge somebody with (e.g., can activate mandatory minimums, dismiss the case, etc.) -> boxes in judges who are held in check by sentencing guidelines.
	* Some limited evidence to suggest prosecutors try to correct for disparities earlier in the pipeline (i.e., the police) -> higher dismissal rates for minority defendants.

#### Pretrial decision making

* Disparities in who gets it and who can pay.
* Those who are detained are more likely to be found guilty (mostly through plea deals).

#### Sentencing

* Evidence of social disadvantage at various stages of the justice system, disparity estimates from any given stage are likely to underestimate the full impact of various punishment inequalities. Especially true in sentencing because it the final stage and subject to the conditioning influences of multiple prior decisions -> police arrest behaviors, prosecutor charging decisions, pretrial detention, pre-sentence investigations, and sentencing recommendations/guidelines.
  
	* <mark>Controlling for e.g., prior record, current charge, or pretrial detention can hide these sources of disparities if they are applied in disparate ways in earlier stages.</mark> #highlight 

#### Post-sentencing

* Disparities in parole/probation revocation.
* Disparities in judicial determinations of sealing one's criminal record.

#### Juvenile justice system

* Police less likely to make arrests when parents are cooperative and can be seen as able to control the child -> Black children more likely to have one parent and police may see them as less able to control the child.
  
* Informal vs. formal case processing. Intake officers can decide to deal with it themselves or formally hand it over to the court.
  
* Extralegal factors are considered -> family circumstance, school performance, etc. potential for bias.
  
* Black children are much more likely to be referred to adult court. 

### Future research

* Future research is needed that takes a holistic approach to explicitly consider how early life events shape contacts with and responses within the criminal justice system. #highlight #paper_idea
  
* Research is needed in following a sample of defendants across multiple decision-making stages and consider the ways in which earlier decisions mediate, moderate, and compound disadvantage.
  
	* We need better tests of the functional forms through which advantage accumulates over time.
	  
	* Less focus on singular outcomes at one specific stage of criminal case processing.
	  
* Need more status variables other than race, gender, and age. Need to understand interaction effects better, too.
  
* Need to understand structural biases in the way laws are passed and polices crafted -> sources of inequality built into existing legal structures (criminal history records, mandatory minimums, risk assessment scores, police deployment strategies etc.) -> cannot assume such variables are straightforward indicators of danger or culpability.
