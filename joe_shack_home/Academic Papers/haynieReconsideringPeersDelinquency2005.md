## Abstract

This paper examines the contribution of peer relations to delinquency from the perspective of two sociological traditions: socialization/normative influence and opportunity. Earlier studies have likely overestimated normative influence by relying on respondents' reports about their friends' behaviors rather than obtaining independent assessments and by inadequately controlling for the tendency to select peers who are similar to oneself. Using detailed social network data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we find support for both the socialization and opportunity models. Adolescents engage in higher rates of delinquency if they have highly delinquent friends and if they spend a great deal of time in unstructured socializing with friends. Yet our results also indicate that (1) the normative influence of peers on delinquency is more limited than indicated by most previous studies, (2) normative influence is not increased by being more closely attached to friends or spending more time with them, (3) the contribution of opportunity is independent from normative influence and of comparable importance, and (4) influences from the peer domain do not mediate the influences of age, gender, family or school.

## My notes

* Interestingly, this paper is also drawing on [[symbolic interactionism]] and [[Routine activity]] theory.
* Controls also come from [[Social control theory|social control]].

* The key takeaway:
	* If unstructured time spent with peers is related to delinquency **only if** your peers are already delinquent, then the opportunity perspective is not so important for understanding how peers matter in regards to delinquency.
	* The opportunity perspective becomes more important if spending more unstructured time with you peers was associated with higher levels of delinquency regardless of the fact that one's peers are delinquent or not.

### What is the research question?

* How do peers matter in regards to delinquency?
	* Is it the case they influence our norms? If so, how strongly or weakly?
	* Is the normative influence of peers related to the nature of your relationship with your peers?
	* Does peer delinquency mediate the effects of other factors on delinquency?
	* Might the perspective from routine activity and opportunity theory be a more useful, or at least a complementary way, to view the situation?
		* Specifically, rather than shaping the views of individuals, peer groups structure our day and present opportunities (or not) for deviant behavior.
		* Is unstructured socializing still related to delinquency after controlling for peer delinquency? In other words, maybe it is only those individuals with delinquent peers who have a lot of unstructured free time or vice versa?

### Why is it important?

* Do your peers influence your own normative views? Or is this a result of self-selection into peer groups already similar to you? If both influences exist, which one is more powerful?
  
* Prior research has demonstrated that network structure moderates the relationship between self-delinquency and peer-delinquency. Specifically, adolescents in very dense friendship networks or in very central positions within their networks have a stronger association with the delinquency rates of their peers.
  
* Many scholars (from the symbolic interactionist perspective and differential association + social learning camp) believe the normative influence from peers is the most important source of the link between self-delinquency and peer-delinquency. However, this study will use improved methods to better address the question. #methods_issue #data_issue 
	* They will deal with selection vs. norm influence.
		* They use a longitudinal research design and a more extensive set of controls including a measure of prior delinquency.
			* Of course, you still have to contend with [[omitted variable bias]]. Although prior work suggests it may not likely be too big an issue. So they do a cross-sectional analysis on Wave 1.
			* Longitudinal research may be too conservative since (in this case) the effects may have attenuated a year later, and you cannot capture the effects at shorter time intervals. They then do a longitudinal analysis where the independent variables come from Wave 1, and the dependent variables come from Wave 2.
	* They will deal with the fact that the standard approach to measuring peer delinquency is to ask the focal participant rather than asking the peers directly. We tend to think of our peers as more similar to ourselves than they actually are ([[assumed similarity]]), and this is a bias.
		* They use peers' own reports of their delinquency.
		* They will also use [[tobit regression]] and other models of deviance to deal with the skewed distribution of the dependent variable.
		  
* The routine activities and opportunity perspective:
	* Situations conducive to deviance are especially prevalent during unstructured socializing with peers in the absence of an authority figure.
		* The presence of peers makes the act more rewarding (e.g., more fun, boosts to reputation).
		* Lack of authority figure reduces the potential for social control responses.
		* The lack of structure creates the opportunity to deviate.
	* Prior research has demonstrated increases in within-individual unstructured socializing time is associated with increases in delinquency and substance use.
	* Peer relations, thus, are not connected to delinquency by the types of friends one chooses. What matters is how much time you spend with them in an unstructured way with adults absent.

### How do you propose to answer it?

* They will use [[Add Health]] data.
* **Dependent variable**: Measure of delinquency is derived from a series of responses to 14 questions. They use [[item response theory]].
* **Independent variables**:
	* **Peer delinquency**. Peers include all those people whom the focal respondent listed as a peer as well as any adolescents who named the focal respondent as a peer. They use the average item response theory score as the measure of your peer's delinquency.
	* **Unstructured socializing**: Based on three questions. For each friendship nomination, respondents indicated whether they hung out after school, over the past weekend, and in general how many times did you hang out. This does not get at time spent socializing without authority figures, though.

### What do you find?

* Socialization or the normative influence of peers is statistically significant even when controlling for prior delinquency and many other controls.
	* However, it seems likely prior studies have overestimated the effect size of peer delinquency because the effect size in this paper is much smaller. This is likely due to data limitations.
	  
* Unstructured socializing time with peers is positively significantly related to self-delinquency even when controlling for prior delinquency and peer delinquency.
	* No evidence that the impact of peer delinquency is greater when respondents feel closer to their friends (social control) or when they spend more time in unstructured socializing with their friends (differential association + social learning).
	* I.e., if adolescents view each other as friends, it does not matter how strongly attached they feel or how much time they spend together, they will influence you.
	* Spending lots of time hanging out with friends is conducive to delinquency even if your friends are not particularly delinquent. This presents a *slight challenge* to differential association + social learning theory. #theory_challenge
		* I suppose proponents would argue back it is exposure to messages and patterns and not people which matters. I disagree with the authors of this paper that this represents a fundamental challenge. #highlight #disagree.
		  
* Peer influence does not really mediate the effects of any of the other variables which is in contrast to previous findings. However, previous findings often found large effects due to the improper way they measured peer deviance.
  
* The authors conclude opportunity (unstructured time spent socializing) as well as peer influence (differential association + social learning) are important.
