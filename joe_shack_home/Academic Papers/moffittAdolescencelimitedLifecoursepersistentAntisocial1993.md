## Abstract

Presents a dual taxonomy to reconcile 2 incongruous facts about antisocial behavior: (1) It shows impressive continuity over age, but (2) its prevalence changes dramatically over age, increasing almost 10-fold temporarily during adolescence. This article suggests that delinquency conceals 2 distinct categories of individuals, each with a unique natural history and etiology: A small group engages in antisocial behavior of one sort or another at every life stage, whereas a larger group is antisocial only during adolescence. According to the theory of life-course-persistent antisocial behavior, children's neuro-psychological problems interact cumulatively with their criminogenic environments across development, culminating in a pathological personality. According to the theory of adolescence-limited antisocial behavior, a contemporary maturity gap encourages teens to mimic antisocial behavior in ways that are normative and adjustive.

## My notes

Two groups of offenders: **life-course persistent** and **adolescence limited**. The adolescent limited group is much larger and engages in offending for only a short period of time (adolescence). The life-course persistent group is much smaller but comprises the vast majority of crimes committed. They also engage in deviant activities throughout their entire life.

### Life-Course Persistent

Origins are in an interaction between the child’s neuro-psychological vulnerabilities and criminogenic environments. Prognosis is pretty bleak. They have terrible life outcomes. Neuro=psychological problems arise in the fetal brain due to maternal drug abuse, poor prenatal nutrition, prenatal exposure to toxic agents, or other brain injuries -> after birth can persist due to lack of nutrition, stimulation, and even affection.

Poor impulse control and motor/cognitive skills even as a child. Independent of race and class. Typically aren’t born into supportive environments though which exacerbate their underlying conditions. Claims poor parenting is often a response to the child being difficult. “The child acts, the environment reacts, and the child reacts back in mutually interlocking evocative interaction.” #quote 

The poor life outcomes are maintained in reacting to ambiguous social cues aggressively and self-selecting into environments that support their aggression. Cumulative consequences further preclude them from integrating with society. Contemporary consequences also do as well (aggressive demeanor makes it hard for them to maintain relationships and jobs). She uses the term **snares**.

These people are thus victims of a pathology. In contrast to Sampson & Laub [[sampsonLifeCourseViewDevelopment2005]], argues such things as marriage and employment aren’t going to be signals of desistance but could offer opportunities for persistence.

### Adolescent Limited

Almost all individuals going through adolescence in the industrialized, Western world commit crime. However it’s limited to adolescence and does not persist into adulthood. Primarily commit crime according to social control/social learning principles. They see it as more rewarding than prosocial behavior.

They begin offending due to social mimicry of the life-course persistent offenders. They mimic them because they seem to be able to enjoy the benefits of being an adult. Increasingly in modernized, Western society individuals reach biological maturity way before society considers them socially mature (sex, drinking, voting, driving, working). This gap between biology and the ability to satisfy these urges cause individuals to turn to crime. **Maturity gap**.

Not only that, these actions are a way for young people to assert independence. Society doesn’t have maturity rituals or ordeals anymore so young people invent their own in a way.

Not every teenager offends (late onset of puberty, few opportunities to mimic antisocial behavior, rituals to introduce them into adulthood).

These youth then go on to desist as the maturity gap disappears, and they realize antisocial behavior isn’t conducive to generating rewards or outcomes they would like. Unlike the life-course offenders, they’re exempt from the cumulative and contemporary consequences of the pathology that afflict life-course offenders. In fact, this offending can be seen as normal.
