## Abstract

Increasing evidence shows great diversity in the effects of the criminal sanction. Legal punishment either reduces, increases, or has no effect on future crimes, depending on the type of offenders, offenses, social settings, and levels of analysis. A theory of “defiance” helps explain the conditions under which punishment increases crime. Procedural justice (fairness or legitimacy) of experienced punishment is essential for the acknowledgment of shame, which conditions deterrence; punishment perceived as unjust can lead to unacknowledged shame and defiant pride that increases future crime. Both “specific” defiance by individuals and “general” defiance by collectivities results from punishment perceived as unfair or excessive, unless deterrent effects counterbalance defiance and render the net effect of sanctions irrelevant. By implication, crime might be reduced more by police and courts treating all citizens with fairness and respect than by increasing punishments. A variety of research designs can be used to test, refine, or reject the theory.

## My notes

### Introduction

Legal punishment has been shown to reduce, increase, or have no effect on future crimes depending on the type of offender, offense, social setting, and level of analysis.

[[Theory of defiance]] helps explain under which conditions punishment increases crime. [[Procedural justice]] (perceived fairness or legitimacy) of the experienced punishment is essential for the acknowledgement of shame which conditions deterrence. Punishment that is perceived to be unjust can lead to future crime as it breeds prideful defiance. Specific and collective defiance can emerge. Defiance and deterrence can counteract each other achieving net zero effects on crime.

Crime would be reduced if police and courts treated all citizens with respect.

Helps us break out of the gridlock of [[labeling theory]] and [[Deterrence theory|deterrence theory]]. Integration of the following three theories.

* [[Reintegrative shaming]] -> Sanctions can be reintegrative or stigmatizing. Do you shame the act or the actor? Reintegrative sanctions control crime while stigmatizing sanctions increase it.
* Procedural justice -> Fair sanctions increase compliance with the law while unfair sanctions decrease compliance with the law.
* Sociology of [[master emotions]] -> Pride and shame dominate humans responses to sanctions.

### Principles of the theory

When will a sanction lead to less crime?

* To the degree that the punished believes in the ***legitimacy*** of the sanction and the person(s) administering the sanction.
* The strength of the ***social bond*** that the sanctioned has with the sanctioning agent.
* To the degree they feel ***shameful*** for their actions (and do not deny it).
* To the degree they feel ***prideful*** for their association with their community or proud of their isolation from the community.

* When poorly bonded offenders accept the shame of a sanction, the sanction will be irrelevant or deterrent.
* When poorly bonded offenders do not accept the shame of a sanction, the sanction will be criminogenic.
* When a well-bonded offender defines a sanction as unfair, the sanction may be irrelevant or have its deterrent effect weakened, but it is unlikely the offender will be pridefully defiant.

When will sanctions be seen as unfair?

* **Respect** -> Those administering the sanction should have respect for the punished. As Braithwaite pointed out, reintegration can be cruel and vicious. So Sherman is arguing that a punishment can be stigmatizing and reintegrative on one dimension and respectful, restrained vs. cruel, vicious on another dimension.
	* See the powerful role of police disrespect (although Sherman points out that it is hard to disentangle the effects of police disrespect and brutality from the increased involvement of public crimes that the youth, minorities, and impoverished often engage in).

Patterns of defiance
* Specific vs. general
* Direct vs. indirect (offending against sanctioning agent vs. offending against a vicarious agent)
* Create typologies of specific direct defiance or general indirect defiance.

### Puzzles

Similar criminal sanctions have opposite or different effects in different social settings, on different kinds of offenders and offenses, and at different levels of analysis.

#### Individual differences

* Personality type.
* Employment (more effective on employed people).
* Age (more effective on older people).
* Perceived legitimacy of the law.

#### Social setting differences

* **Juvenile arrests** -> mixed evidence.
* **Juvenile court processing** -> formal vs. informally handled. Generally speaking, more formal court processing is associated with higher rates of future recidivism.
* **Domestic violence arrests** -> No conclusive evidence [[berkDeterrentEffectArrest1992]].
* **Capital punishment** -> No conclusive evidence.
* **Police brutality** -> Has at times produced compliance with white supremacy while at other times leading to more compliance.

#### General vs. specific deterrence

#### Differences and similarities across offense types

### General findings

* Violations in expectations of fairness is a risk factor for sanctions increasing crime, specifically and generally.
* Sanctions are likely to increase (or fail to deter) crime among out-groups while they deter crime among in-groups, specifically and generally.

### Problems with deterrence and labeling

* Deterrence cannot explain why some sanctions increase crime.
* Labeling cannot explain why some sanctions deter crime nor is there a *general labeling theory* which can explain the effect of sanctions at the group level beyond individual-level analysis.
	* Reintegrative shaming is a step in the right direction, but it lacks the theoretical rigor, currently, to explain the diversity of findings from the sanctions literature.
* Procedural justice does not explain why some people in some social situations find sanctions unfair. It also does not explain why this leads to more crime against other citizens rather than against the government. Turns to [[Social control theory|social control]] and [[blackCrimeSocialControl1983]] to help explain why this might lead to more interpersonal crime.
