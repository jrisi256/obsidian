## Abstract

One of the most notable political developments of the last thirty years has been increasing public and governmental demand for the quantification of social phenomena, yet sociologists generally have paid little attention to the spread of quantification or the significance of new regimes of measurement. Our article addresses this oversight by analyzing quantification – the production and communication of numbers – as a general sociological phenomenon. Drawing on scholarship across the social sciences in Europe and North America as well as humanistic inquiry, we articulate five sociological dimensions of quantification and call for an ethics of numbers.

## My notes

### Introduction

What does quantification and, specifically, numbers allows us to do? Numbers and quantification have different purposes and meanings depending on the context.

#### Numbers *mark*

* Used to identify unique units (e.g., football jerseys, [[Dewey Decimal System]]).

#### Numbers commensurate

* Numbers transform all differences into one of quantity.

### Numbers require work

* Quantification takes considerable work as well as investments in infrastructure and coordination. It requires not just the creation of the statistical and counting apparatus but also changes to the overall society to make quantification happen.
  
	* Quantification can also denote *seriousness* and *legitimacy* for nation-states as well as businesses.

### Numbers intervene

* Despite claims of objectivity and neutrality (reflecting the world as is), numbers cause people to think and act differently.
  
* The modern nation-building project depends upon quantification to hold all the disparate, amorphous parts together into a more homogeneous whole that can be contemplated (and then acted upon) -> affect resources, status, and opportunities, different numbers for different groups.
  
* Numbers can create or reinforce categories of people. It can confer recognition on a new social status in society. It can be good (e.g., Alfred Kinsey in the 1940's surveyed people about their sexual experience and found non-heterosexual relations to be much more common than previously thought -> authors claimed this helped to spark gay rights movement) -> helps to create a gay identity.
  
	* The irony being that Kinsey refused to label people as homosexual or heterosexual and argued only behaviors were. He argued it made no sense and was too coarse to label people in such a way.

### Numbers discipline

* Numbers exert discipline on those they depict -> numbers designed to describe behavior can then control that behavior. Creates standards and norms and behaviors to aspire to.
  
* Allows for individuals/groups to *see* something in such a way so as to be able to then control it.
  
	* Sometimes discipline is a by-product vs. intentional (e.g., audits are intentional discipline, the US College News Rankings have discipline as a by-product).)

### Numbers confer authority and are authoritative

* Numbers persuade because people find them credible ways of knowing. Why?
  
	* They represent accuracy and validity in their representation.
	  
		* Numbers are seen as accurate representations of reality. The response is [[constructivism]] which sees the the objects of study (targeted by measurement) as negotiated between researcher and subject and constantly changing.
		  
		* Thus objects appear more or less real depending upon how successfully the supporting groups made the numbers seem durable, legitimate, and inevitable.
		  
		* "Statistics help to create the reality they measure by providing a language for accessing it and techniques for its manipulation." #quote  
		  
		* Related arguments are that objectification allow for collaborations between groups who may otherwise be unable to communicate and bridge their differences in how they view the world and how they want the world to change. -> cost-benefit analysis, audits, rankings, performance measures, [[Sentencing guidelines|sentencing guidelines]] -> replace trust in persons with trust in numbers.
		  
	* They are useful in solving problems.
	* They accumulate and link users who have investments in the numbers.
	* Associated with rationality and objectivity.

### Numbers have an aesthetic quality to them

* Especially when represented in tabular or graphical form -> the creators of such products, the authors argue, want their creations to be beautiful. What counts as good and compelling changes very rapidly, and it is very discipline-specific. It requires much skill to create compelling data visualizations and also to interpret them. There are some unchanging and everlasting important qualities:
  
	* **Clarity**
	* **Parsimony**
	  
* Occasionally, the graph itself becomes the object of fascination. Data visualization is an important glue which holds disparate things together in a comprehensible way.

### Conclusions

* Numbers are social.
* Numbers facilitate an ontology in which the real becomes coextensive with what is measurable.
	* Measurement can help us see complicated things in ways which make it possible to intervene effectively.
	* Measurement can narrow our appraisal of value and relevance to that which is measurable at the expense of other ways of knowing (e.g., education is now routinely measured as years of schooling).
