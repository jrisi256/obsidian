## Abstract

This article engages the dynamic role of the crime image and more specifically the mug shot, in a contemporary anti-methamphetamine media campaign known as ‘Faces of Meth’. Understood here as a pedagogical policing program, Faces of Meth attempts to deter methamphetamine use through graphic ‘before meth’ and ‘after meth’ images of the faces of white meth users. Our objective is not to evaluate the actual effectiveness of these fear appeals. Rather we discuss how the photographs are largely structured by and embedded within already existing cultural anxieties about the figure of ‘white trash’, reflecting both the dominance and precariousness of white social position.

## Highlighted Notes

### Research Question

Images are key features of contemporary punishment.

### Culture of Punishment

This implicates us since we now engage with these images. On social media, in real life, etc. Allows us to shame those who are addicted and vindicate ourselves for being morally superior.

Cuts away the context. Makes it all seem very objective. Invokes mug shots. Your ugliness is a symbol of your inner ugliness.

### Doing damage to Whiteness

Explicit linking of poverty and whiteness. Side note, I think Whiteness is a bad name or at least too ambiguous of a concept.

*Everything we had to suppress to maintain our lifestyles*. How dare you pollute one's WHITE body and give up your white privilege and bourgeois sensibilities.

I do not really understand this undercurrent I see in these texts where these lifestyles are ones that I would want to live. Like if it weren't for immense governmental power, everyone would be living in this state? I think there are many aspects of these lifestyles which are totally unappealing to a lot of people for obvious reasons. #disagree

How could a rational person have done this? They must be monstrous.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EQH6GL7W?page=326&annotation=W8PWBA3S) “On the other, the faces beg ‘why would someone do this to themselves?’ This calculus of rational individualism arouses a vindictive cognitive dissonance aimed toward those seeming to shirk everyday drudgeries shouldered by ‘respectable citizens’ and provides psycho-centric frames or diagnostic logics defining self and the monstrous Other.” ([Linnemann and Wall, 2013, p. 326](zotero://select/library/items/IZ5HYP8I)) 

I do not think I agree with this. I don't know it's complicated. #disagree See above comments.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EQH6GL7W?page=327&annotation=YETYMWMP) “... it can be argued that much of the collective impulse to view and punish these ‘faces’ springs from the longing for the ‘sacred suspension of ordinary rules’ and a secret admiration of the transgressive—the enduring human fascination with forbidden people, places and things.” ([Linnemann and Wall, 2013, p. 327](zotero://select/library/items/IZ5HYP8I))

Images capture reality but also shape it.
