## My notes

1. **Official Definition of Crime** -> Crime as a legal definition of human conduct is created by agents of the dominant class in a politically organized society. Crime is not inherent in behavior, but it is a judgment made about actions and characteristics of others. The greater the amount of definitions of crime, the greater the amount of crime.

2. **Formulating Definitions of Crime** -> Definitions of crime are composed of behaviors that conflict with the interests of the dominant class. Change as the interests of the dominant class change. The interests of the powerful not only reflected in the definitions of crime and the kinds of penal sanctions attached to them but also in the rules created for enforcing and administering them, for treating and punishing the criminal, for preventing and controlling crime.

3. **Applying Definitions of Crime** -> Definitions of crime are applied by the class that has the power to shape the enforcement and administration of criminal law. Must not only formulate the law but also enforce it. “Crime is political behavior and the criminal is part of a minority group without sufficient public support to dominate control of the police power of the state.” #quote 
	1. The probability the definitions are applied varies according to how much the powerless threaten the powerful. The power of enforcement is vested in legal agents who are also intensely local thus definitions of crime and how they’re enforced vary locally.

4. **How Behavior Patterns Develop in Relation to Definitions of Crime** -> Behavior patterns are structured in relation to definitions of crime. All persons act in reference to some normative system. The action taken against the behavior (not the behavior itself) is what makes an act criminal and those in power formulate and define the normative system. The powerless are often excluded from this process so their behavior patterns aren’t included in the normative system and have a higher likelihood of being considered deviant.
	1. People create their own personal action patterns which are formed in participating with others (structured opportunities, learning experiences, interpersonal association, self-conceptions). Being defined as a criminal leads to self-identification as criminal and a learning of how to play the criminal role. Increased experience with definitions of crime increases the probability of developing actions which may be defined as criminal which leads to creation of a criminal self-identity.
	2. The definers of crime and criminally defined are involved in reciprocal action patterns. One influences the other which then in turns causes a reverse effect.

5. **Ideology of Crime** -> Constructed and diffused by dominant class to maintain hegemony. Concepts of crime are accompanied with ideas about the nature of crime, relevance of crime, offender characteristics, appropriate reaction to crime, spread through communication and media networks. Ideology of crime is also formed by state investigations and state law (defines what are the problem actions and how we’re going to deal with it). Thus the state in many ways picks who the criminals are to be.

6. **Constructing the social reality of crime** -> Social reality of crime is constructed by all the above steps. Formulation, application, development of behavior patterns, and construction of ideology.
