## Abstract

The position advanced in this article is that, rather than presenting two analytically distinct theories as often claimed in the literature, the [[anomie]] perspective articulated by Robert Merton reflects one multilevel theory of how macro-level social and cultural conditions increase the likelihood of deviance among individuals. In this article, I translate Merton's multilevel theory into a precise causal model and describe how it accounts for variation in instrumental crime both within and across social collectivities. I then highlight the research implications of this multilevel model, including the types of data and methods needed to evaluate the model and the research puzzles that have been largely overlooked owing to the single-level approaches applied in previous explications of Merton's theory.

## My notes

### Introduction

* Some have argued that Merton proposed two analytically distinct theoretical arguments.
	* The first theory focuses on aggregate-level features to help explain in variation in deviance rates across social units.
	* The second theory focuses on social psychological processes through which individuals become blocked from pursuing a culturally internalized goal and becomes motivated, perhaps out of frustration, to engage in deviance.
* Baumer argues it is really one multilevel theory. Thinking about anomie in this way reveals how individual-level features may be conditioned by macro-level features and vice versa. Additionally, it links the macro-level features directly to the individual adaptations which emerge.

### Explication of the theory

* Emergent properties of communities shape value commitments of individuals which lead to individual differences in deviant behavior.
* I believe two-way arrows indicate a moderating relationship.
* Dashed lines indicate research puzzles.
* Saw-toothed arrows indicate complicated moderating relationships, I think.

* Four main causal segments:
	* **Production of differences across social units in levels of anomie**.
		* X2, X3, and X4 interact to produce a lack of consensus on what constitutes the appropriate way to purse monetary success goals (Y1).
	* **Assimilation of cultural values**.
		* Previous work has suffered a lot in this regard. Individual-level focused work does not address how the broader social and cultural context affects individuals.
		* Macro-level interpretations do not explain how these macro-level variables would make it more likely for individuals to commit crime nor do they explain why most individuals in these conditions do not commit crime (variability in how people respond to the same conditions).
		* Baumer believes that individuals cognitively adapt to their cultural environment by accepting or rejecting culturally valued goals and/or means and different adaptations lead to different types of behaviors. In the figure, this is represented by X2 causing Y3., X3 causing Y4, Y1 causing Y4, and Y2.
		* Cultural assimilation is not perfect and individuals may or may not assimilate for a variety of reasons (presence and importance of alternative, non-monetary goals, one's position in the social structure, one's perceived or actual access to legitimate means of pursuing important cultural goals).
			* Limited access to legitimate opportunities (Y5) moderates the causal effect of commitment to pursue monetary goals through legitimate means (Y3 causing Y4).
		* **Concrete example**: Individuals who grew up in social units with a stronger cultural emphasis on monetary success goals will likely be stronger committed to achieving those goals. Those individuals exposed to social settings characterized by a weak emphasis on using legitimate means for pursuing monetary success and those characterized by high levels of anomie to have the weakest commitment to pursuing monetary goals through legitimate means.
			* There still exists a lot of individual variation in commitment to culturally prescribed values. A lot of people will likely not be committed to pursuing monetary success. Even if many people are committed, it is likely only a small percentage would use illegitimate means to do so. Among those, it is likely those who have the most blocked opportunities (living in poverty, little education, chronically unemployed) -> **This process is necessary but not sufficient to induce crime, though**.
	* **Proximate and highly contingent causes of deviance**.
		* Y3 and Y4 causing Y8. Individuals are committed to monetary success goals but have little means (actual or perceived as measured by access to legitimate employment and a good education) to do so. Moderating variables play a crucial role here in amplifying this effect (social position, perceived risks and rewards).
			* Blocked access to legitimate means does not produce *innovative behavior*. It defines who will be most susceptible (most likely?) to commit crime or engage in innovative behaviors.
			* I.e., opportunity structures dictate the range of choices available to an individual. Y3, Y4, Y5 -> Y8.
		* Variation in levels of instrumental crime between social units is due to compositional differences in individual attributes (attachment to culturally prescribed success goals and attachment to achieving those success goals in legitimate ways) -> even still, stated a lot, these individuals are not expected to engage in crime all the time or even at all -> those who feel particularly alienated from legitimate opportunities, those who lack major commitments to other culturally valued goals, those who perceive the risks to be low and benefits high, those who are dissatisfied with their current monetary status, and those have been exposed to a variety of pro-criminal messages #da_social-learning_theory .
	* **Reciprocal relationships between levels of instrumental crime and cultural structure**.
		* Feedback loops wherein large numbers of people who do not follow the legitimate pathway *successfully* induces others to also not use legitimate pathways. This would be Y8 -> X3. This suggests that social units with high levels of anomie will be very hard to fix. This also means all social units (absent interventions) should continue to escalate in levels of anomie.

### How to operationalize the model

* Measurement could happen at any macro-level unit (nation, states, counties, etc.).
* You would need direct indicators of the cultural (e.g., customs, rituals, media content, valued symbols) and structural conditions (e.g., economic variables) to which sample members are exposed.
* You would need information on the social positions of each sample member, the extent to which they have assimilated cultural values, and measures of involvement in criminal justice activities.
* Still much work to be done! For example, why do different societies produce different levels of assimilation of cultural values? Long list of research questions posed. Do individual-level effects dissipate if you move to a less anomic environment? What variables explain the variation in assimilation of anomic cultural values?
* How can we incorporate insights from other perspectives? E.g., association with deviant peers, attachment to parents, etc.

### Summary

* Merton argues that a strong commitment to the pursuit of monetary success goals and a weakened commitment to the legitimate means of pursuing those goals increases the likelihood of instrumental crime. (X3, X4 -> Y8).
	* Features of the social units (e.g., degree of emphasis on monetary goals, degree of emphasis on using legitimate means, degree of consensus around the goals and means) -> moderate X3 and X4's relationship in Y8.
* Limited access to legitimate opportunities amplifies this interactive effect (Y3, Y4, Y5 -> Y8).
* Differences across social units is a function of differences across places in the fraction of the population who are committed to monetary success goals and institutionalized means and who have limited access to legitimate opportunities for pursuing monetary goals.
	* Stated using [[Multilevel modeling|multilevel modeling]], there would be substantial variation across social units (level 2), but once individuals were accounted for (level 1) the variation would be fully accounted for.
