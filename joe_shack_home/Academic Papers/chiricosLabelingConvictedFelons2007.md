## Abstract

Florida law allows judges to withhold adjudication of guilt for individuals who have been found guilty of a felony and are being sentenced to probation. Such individuals lose no civil rights and may lawfully assert they had not been convicted of a felony. Labeling theory would predict that the receipt of a felony label could increase the likelihood of recidivism. Reconviction data for 95,919 men and women who were either adjudicated or had adjudication withheld show that those formally labeled are significantly more likely to recidivate in 2 years than those who are not. Labeling effects are stronger for women, whites, and those who reach the age of 30 years without a prior conviction. Second-level indicators of county characteristics (e.g., crime rates or concentrated disadvantage) have no significant effect on the adjudication/recidivism relationship.

## My notes

### Introduction

What is this adjudication procedure? Individuals who have been found guilty of a felony (through judge, jury, or plea) can avoid being labeled a convicted felon. Judges can *withhold adjudication* for convicted felons being sentenced to probation. Offenders are who equivalent in factual guilt may either be labeled a felon or not. For those who have had adjudication withheld, no civil rights are lost, and they may say they have never had a felony conviction. Those who are formally adjudicated are treated as normal, convicted felons.

### Prior research

The consequences of formal sanctions are likely dependent on the characteristics of the offender. Labeling effects will vary depending on the person. The four variables being studied in this paper include: **race**, **sex**, **prior record**, and **stakes in conformity**. Labeling theory has not demonstrated consistently how these variables should theoretically respond to the labeling procedure. For example, some argue those with higher stakes in conformity will be ***more affected*** by being labeled a criminal (they have more to lose) vs. some argue those with higher stakes in conformity will be ***less affected*** by labels (they have the social resources available to overcome the labeling).

Additionally, it is likely that individual-level characteristics also depend upon community-level contexts in terms of how an individual responds to being labeled. They examine at the community-level: [[Concentrated disadvantage|concentrated disadvantage]], concentrated extremes of affluence and poverty, indexed crime rates, and police presence.

### Data and methods

Use [[Multilevel modeling|multilevel modeling]] where the first level is the individual and the second level is the county.

Data on 71,548 male offenders and 24,371 offenders found guilty of a felony and sentenced to probation in Florida between 2000 and 2002.

**Dependent variable**: Recidivism is operationalized as 1/0 if the felony probationer was convicted of another felony for a new offense within 2 years of being sentenced.

**Level 1 Independent Variables**: Adjudication formally applied or not, race/ethnicity, crime type (property, drug, or violent), seriousness of crime (Florida Sentencing Guidelines), prior record (Florida guidelines), sex, age, and **high stakes in conformity** (those who have reached age 30 and avoided a criminal record up to the current offense).

**Level 2 Independent Variables**: Crime rate per 100,000 residents, number of police per 100,000 residents, concentrated disadvantage, and [[index of concentration at the extremes]].

Use [[Inverse Mills Ratio]] to partially account for selection bias. It is possible there are unobserved factors which influence the outcome of interest as well as that influence whether or not an individual is formally adjudicated or not.

They [[grand mean center]] their variables.

### Findings

Analyses show those formally labelled as felons are statistically significantly more likely to recidivate in 2 years than those who are not. Labeling effects are stronger for women, White-Americans, and for those with greater stakes in conformity. Second-level indicators of county characteristics have no significant effect.

“In this case, minimizing harm at the individual level has consequences for reducing harm in the broader community.” The pattern of findings suggests that the consequences of labeling are greater for those who would otherwise be considered less likely to recidivate (greatest threat to their self-identity, more to lose). Those who are generally more likely to recidivate are less disadvantaged by a formal label. #quote 

Would seem to run counter to the expectation raised by Sampson & Laub that deficits would pile up faster for those who are already disadvantaged (the findings here do not necessarily disprove that) although this may be due to county-level characteristics not being granular enough.

Findings consistent with greater vulnerability labeling hypothesis which says that labeling is more consequential for those with higher stakes in conformity.
