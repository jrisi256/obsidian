## My notes

### Introduction

Change was in the air -> Judges had too much authority, idiosyncratic and racially biased decisions, procedural unfairness, unjust disparities. Bipartisan (liberals focused on the injustices, conservatives focused on the leniency and inconsistency). The [[Determinate sentencing]] revolution -> [[Mandatory Minimum Sentences]], [[truth-in-sentencing]], life without parole, abolish parole, [[Sentencing guidelines|sentencing guidelines]], narrow discretion. Primary purpose is to deter and apportion out fair punishment (offenders cannot be rehabilitated, rational actors like the rest of us).

### Review of the policies

1. Sentencing Guidelines -> Judge Frankel proposed sentencing commissions to create presumptive sentencing guidelines because they had necessary expertise and were shielded from politics. Frankel’s reforms proved most effective. Other ideas included voluntary systems, computer sentencing information systems, other related ideas. They didn’t really work because A) they were voluntary (some might argue they can be successful), B) judges really only care about what they think for a given trial and not what others have done.  
      
2. Mandatory Sentences -> Should be repealed. Have few deterrent effects and result in unjust and harsh punishments and many times willful circumvention by courtroom actors. Also often used to extract guilty pleas -> prosecutors abuse this power, uniquely American problem because: 1) Elected or appointed political creatures, elsewhere they’re nonpartisan career civil servants, 2) Prosecutors’ day-to-day decisions are never subject to judicial review -> American prosecutors are adversarial and not evenhanded.  
      
3. Federal Sentencing Guidelines -> A failure and should be rebuilt from the ground up. Within 2 years of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 being passed, more than 200 federal district judges declared all or part of it unconstitutional -> guidelines are no longer mandatory but advisory -> had a pretty promising start (Ed Kennedy, Judge Frankel, bipartisanship, large budget, good staff) -> turned out to be too factionalized, politics still played a role, “Tough-on-crime” won out over reduced disparities and greater fairness -> judges hated it, very restrictive and detailed and technical, too harsh -> disparities have worsened.  
      
4. Racial disparities -> Presumptive sentencing guidelines help but most states don’t have them. Many reasons. Focus on drug crimes, “Minority citizens neither use illicit drugs nor engage in trafficking more than white. They are however much more likely to be arrested, prosecuted, and convicted.” -> Why? -> Focus on inner city enforcement, racial profiling. #quote 

	1. Repeal all mandatory minimum sentences.    
	2. Create enforceable mechanisms to prohibit racial profiling.
	3. Educate criminal justice actors about implicit and explicit bias.
	4. Undertake racial impact studies to learn where the most harm is being done, why, what laws/policies/practices and consider how to change them.

5. Predicting dangerousness -> This is an unjust practice that should be stopped. They do have appropriate correctional uses in classifying offenders for admission to treatment programs. (I think this refers to their use in sentencing only it would seem). -> Would Tonry also oppose their use in pretrial sentencing? #question 
    
	1. Seldom very accurate. Violence is rare.
	2. Predictions haven’t really improved.
	3. Use variables the individual has no control over and should not be morally responsible for.
	4. Use variables which aren’t the state’s business and are personal choices (marital status, education, residential stability) -> aggravate disparities.
	5. Use variables which incorporate criminal history which are biased against minority groups.
	6. Solution? Abolish it or only allow for its use in reducing sentences.  
      
6. Case Processing -> Cannot standardize sentences nor eliminate disparities at the state or federal level. Cannot micromanage sentences in such a big and diverse system. The contexts are so wide and diverse it’s impossible to guarantee every crime is going to get the same sentence -> local contexts and problems will also guide the implementation of the law -> prosecutors, judges, defense lawyers work in concert in local contexts to develop their own *going rates* for certain crimes, have limited resources, policy priorities, standard ways of doing business. *The law is local*. Of course policy changes at the broader level will force change, but it will often not be the change predicted or anticipated (or at least the degree).  
      
7. Punishment -> The focus should be on community correctional programming. Imprisonment is not cost efficient, it is cruel, and it increases re-offending. “Unconditional discharges and unsupervised probation should be the defaults. Otherwise, probation agencies will waste scarce resources supervising low-risk offenders.” -> Resources are better devoted to high-risk offenders. #quote
      
8. Parole Release -> Except (maybe, need strong opportunities to appeal) in states with effective presumptive guidelines, parole release is important. It is just and cost-effective, and it should be used. They can even out disparities, they can address prison overcrowding, and they can tailor supervisions to the individual. They give prisoners hope. It was abolished in so many places because so many saw it as the worst part of [[Indeterminate sentencing]], but it can be fixed with parole guidelines! With new tough-on-crime rhetoric, parole boards have become incredibly risk-averse.
      
9. Luck and Leadership: The sentencing reform effort of the last half-century deserves a failing grade. Good intentions(?) but evidence of success can only be found in a few initiatives in a few states (it can be found though!). Tough-on-crime movement really set things back.
    
### The Way Forward

1. Much harder to achieve political support needed to enact sentencing commissions and oversee implementation vs. mandatory minimums and related ilk. Offenders are easy political targets. Sentencing commissions are also easy targets (judges, prosecutors, victims’ rights groups).
    
2. Need politically savvy leaders and unusually able staff.
    
3. Prevailing ways of thought change.
