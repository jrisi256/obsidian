## Abstract

This article draws on Agnew's [[anomie|general strain theory]] to explain community differences in crime rates. After reviewing the communities and crime research, the author discusses the ways in which community-level variables contribute to strain, including the failure to achieve positively valued goals and the loss of positive stimuli/presentation of negative stimuli. The ways in which community-level variables condition the impact of strain on crime are then examined.

## My notes

### Introduction

* [[Social disorganization]] and [[Social control theory|social control]] -> Certain community characteristics reduce level of social control.
* Subcultural Deviance Theory: Draws on [[differential association]] theory -> community values and norms lead some individuals to viewing crime as a desirable or justifiable response.
* Relative Deprivation Theory: Draws on Merton and anomie -> High levels of inequality lead to some individuals experiencing strain or frustration.
* GST draws on relative deprivation but goes beyond it too.

### Introduction to the theory
    
* GST is going to argue differences in community crime rates are not only a function of differences in social control but also in differences in the motivation of crime. Stress/strain is a major source of criminal motivation. It will explain the below facts:
	* Communities with high tend to have these characteristics:
		* Economic deprivation.
		* Inequality.
		* Overcrowded.
		* High population mobility.
		* High % nonwhite.
		  
	* These facts can be explained by the following mechanisms:
		* **Selection/retention of strained individuals**: Those under economic strain are likely to move into deprived communities because they cannot afford elsewhere. Cannot move out. Non-strained individuals move out. The communities also importantly cause even more strain on the already strained individuals.
		* **Goal-Blockage**: Economic Strain, Status Deprivation, Discrimination: In particular the goals of money, status/respect, and desire to be treated justly/fairly.
			* Emphasis on monetary success, development of “community culture” stressing money.
			* Jobs are inaccessible, physically and skill wise. Few teachers, no chance to network. Add-on factors: negative impacts on childcare, schools and school prep, little spending money available for adolescents.
			* Status is achieved through ostentatious displays of wealth, tough demeanor, willing to verbally and physically abuse others who disrespect you. Comes from inability to achieve status through legitimate channels.
		* **Relative Deprivation**: Compare themselves to advantaged others and decide they want and deserve what they have, but they cannot gain it through legitimate means. These communities also increase absolute deprivation.
			* This also influences what goals we set for ourselves and how blocked our ability to achieve those goals is.
		* **Increased presence of noxious stimuli and decreased presence of positive stimuli**.
			* Loss of Positive Stimuli/Gain Negative stimuli, Economic/job adversity, Family disruption (child abuse, sexual problems, housework burdens, psychological distress).
			* May have also had lower tolerance for stressful/provocative social displays (prolonged eye contact).
			* Increasing signs of incivility: vandalism, street harassment, unsupervised teenage groups, litter/garbage, abandoned housing, poor lighting → index of the negative treatment residents must endure.
		* The strains within the community are more likely to **increase rates of negative affect** which may partly mediate the relationship between community characteristics and crime.
			* Social cleavages: Undermining of social relationships which leads to exploitative and manipulative relationships built on mutual mistrust and estrangement.
			* Vicarious Strain: More likely to witness others experiencing strain.
			* Frequency of interaction with angry/frustrated people: Not only produces angry/frustrated individuals but also increases likelihood such individuals will interact with one another. Further increases strain in the community.
		* Leads to an **aggregated negative effect** (anger, frustration).
		* These strains create an **amplifying loop**. Increased crime rates increase community deterioration which increases strain. Criminal victimization is a major source of strain, and victimization is more common in neighborhoods with high crime rates.

### Conditioning variables

- Conditioning variables affecting how negative effects leads to crime (since not all strained individuals turn to crime).
	- Alternative goals/identities.
	- Public nature of adversity.
	- External Attribution of blame.
	- Low coping ability.
	- Low social support.
	- Low Social Control.
	- Opportunities for crime.
	- Values conducive to crime

### Important considerations

- **Prediction** -> it’ll be most prominent in neighborhoods with highly visible upper class, they’re perceived as similar, and in which individuals are encouraged to be upwardly mobile, thus feelings of injustice arise. For social science: 1) high levels of inequality within and between neighborhoods, 2) illicit markets are common, 3) people hold egalitarian beliefs about the ability of all to achieve monetary success, 4) inequality is linked to race, 5) there are large differences in the economic returns to education by group, 6) people score high on those factors which increase likelihood of criminal response to strain.
  
- Community characteristics have a direct and indirect effect on individual strain. Direct effects aren’t mediated by individual traits e.g. imagine two individuals completely the same except one lives in a deprived community, they’ll be subject to more strain. But communities also have an indirect effect by selecting for strained individuals and influencing development of individuals (can’t gain skills necessary to achieve goals and thus are more likely to experience adverse situations). Individual-level variables will reduce but not eliminate the direct effect of community characteristics on individual crime.
  
- "If GST has any merit, aggregated levels of anger/frustration should partly mediate the effect of variables like family disruption and unsupervised teenage peer groups on community crime rates.” #quote 

### Summary

* Communities contribute to strain in several ways. First, they influence goals individuals pursue and can achieve. Second, they influence an individual’s sense of relative deprivation. Third, they influence definitions of negative stimuli and degree of exposure to such stimuli. Fourth, they increase the likelihood that strained and angry/frustrated individuals interact with one another.
  
* These strains influence aggregate levels of anger/frustration in the community. Direct effect on community crime rates and partly mediate the effect of community characteristics on crime rates. Communities, themselves, may condition the impact ability for strain to turn into crime in a variety of ways. May make it harder for individuals to cope. May reduce costs for coping through criminal behaviors (drug use).
