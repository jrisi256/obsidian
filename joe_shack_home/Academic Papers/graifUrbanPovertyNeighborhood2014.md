## Abstract

Research on neighborhoods and crime is on a remarkable growth trajectory. In this article, we survey important recent developments in the scholarship on neighborhood effects and the spatial stratification of poverty and urban crime. We advance the case that, in understanding the impact of neighborhoods and poverty on crime, sociological and criminological research would benefit from expanding the analytical focus from residential neighborhoods to the network of neighborhoods that individuals are exposed to during their daily routine activities. This perspective is supported by re-emerging scholarship on activity spaces and macro-level research on inter-neighborhood connections. We highlight work indicating that non-residential contexts add variation in criminogenic exposure, which in turn influence offending behavior and victimization risk. Also, we draw on recent insights from research on gang violence, social and institutional connections, and spatial mismatch and call for advancements in the scholarship on urban poverty that investigates the salience of inter-neighborhood connections in evaluating the spatial stratification of criminogenic risk for individuals and communities.

## Highlighted Notes

### Introduction

The next step in research has to be on where people spend their time outside of the home. Our research agenda needs to turn to understanding how an individual's exposure to *networks of neighborhoods* affects their propensity to commit crime (among other things).

### Previous research

[[Social disorganization]] and [[Routine activity]] theories are seen as the most predictive especially for neighborhoods.

Different ways of measuring neighborhoods:

They identify four scales: the “face-block,” where residents tend to know each other; the “defended neighborhoods,” the smallest areas with distinct identities recognized by outsiders and insiders; the “community of limited liability,” where local participation depends on residents’ attachment to community; and the “expanded communities of limited liability,” a large geographic area in which groups of residents come together only when needed to gain larger traction on specific political or economic decisions.” ([Graif et al., 2014, p. 1143](zotero://select/library/items/YTFA673C))

### Future research

We need to begin studying how people spend their time outside of the home. We need to study networks of neighborhoods.

Moreover, compared with violent crimes, property crimes are committed further away from offenders’ neighborhoods of residence (White 1932). Additionally, Bernasco (2010) found that locations where offenders lived in the past are more likely to be chosen as the location of current offending. Evidence on the importance of non-residential contexts in the study of crime is thus becoming increasingly more salient.” ([Graif et al., 2014, p. 1145](zotero://select/library/items/YTFA673C))

### Methodology

* Nodes (neighborhoods) and ties (relationships between nodes) as units of analysis. Varying definitions of what constitutes a node and a tie depending on the research question.

* Types of analysis -> GIS mapping, spatial analysis, and network analysis.
	* [[Multilevel modeling]] and longitudinal data. Can use network lagged variables.
  
* Types of data used (archival, administrative, survey, GPS and smartphones).
