## Abstract

States have increasingly begun to rely on actuarial [[Risk assessment]] in the courtroom to inform criminal sentencing decisions. Despite this, we know little about the importance of risk for punishment decisions, particularly as the consideration of risk might contribute to racial/ethnic and gender disparity in sentencing. This chapter explores the implications of moving toward a sentencing model with an actuarial consideration of risk by putting risk assessment into a broader context of structured sentencing and judicial decision-making. It examines how legal and extra-legal factors mobilize to signal risk of re-offense at sentencing and discusses the possibilities of bias and disparate impact. A discussion on the relationship between sentencing guidelines and risk assessment policy follows, and recommendations for future lines of research are made.

## My notes

### History of Risk Assessment in Sentencing

- Have been used for quite some time in areas like parole release for over a century.
    
- In the 1960s and 1970s, it was used at sentencing to identify mentally ill offenders. Sustained political, judicial, and academic attacks questioning the accuracy and legality of prediction. Risk assessment wanted in popularity during the time of mass incarceration.
    
- Avenue of reform became [[Sentencing guidelines|sentencing guidelines]]. Additionally policy makers and academics turned away from rehabilitation as a goal. As a result, it became less important to identify those most at-risk and those least at-risk. Create uniformity and just deserts.
    
- Since the 1990s, increasing interest in actuarial risk assessment as part of an evidence-based movement in sentencing and corrections. Public not as supportive of tough-on-crime policies. States need to be more efficient as they’re cash-strapped.
    
- Idea behind modern risk assessment is to help judges identify which offenders can be matched up with less punitive sentences.

### Modern use

- Some worry they’ll exacerbate existing disparities. Marginalized groups systematically score higher on risk instruments. Not much empirical research has been done to show their effects in the courtroom though and subsequent effects on sentencing.
    
- Difference in risk assessment actuarial tool (the model and variables considered. What is it predicting? Find riskiness, match with services) and risk assessment policy making (when and how it’s used) -> more in-depth tools to match with appropriate services is more resource-intensive. Thus most risk assessment tools simply predict risk.
    
### Risk-Needs-Responsivity

- Offenders’ criminogenic characteristics (risks and needs) should be met with appropriate supervision and services. Low-risk offenders should be given less harsh, more supportive sentences and vice versa. Also individuals with specific needs (drug addiction) should be given the right services to address those needs. High and low-risk offenders do better when treated differently.
    
- [[Static risk factors]] -> Don’t change so much (race, gender, age).
    
- [[Dynamic risk factors]] -> Changeable (substance abuse, employment, education, marital status, peers).
    
- This framework stands in contrast to the philosophy of the courtroom: fairness, deterrence, retribution.

- Risk assessment tools aren’t so much predictions as they are *post-dictions* (how did similar people in the past fare on whether or not they recidivated?)

### Policy

- Some hope it will inform judicial decisions without constraining discretion admittedly a low bar but perhaps the least controversial. In fact many risk assessment results are already included in pre-sentence reports. Probation officers have historically been concerned with the riskiness of the offenders they’re serving and who can succeed with less supervision.
    
- Risk assessment can also be useful in the sentencing stage then by helping to divert those low-risk offenders. While this may reduce prison populations, it’s unlikely this will reduce disparity and indeed it may even increase it (picks winners and losers and losers are likely to be minority groups). Even as less absolute numbers of minorities are incarcerated.
    
- Of course risk assessment tools consider the same variables judges do. They may outperform judges in terms of prediction but judges still maintain ultimate discretion. Judges decide to incarcerate and for how long. They, of course, have their own attributions and patterned responses for quickly sorting who may or may not be suitable for incarceration (based largely on [[focal concerns of courtroom actors]]) and not so focused on the narrow consideration of whether they will recidivate.
    
- Can risk assessment help in making more accurate predictions? In some ways it would largely confirm judge decision-making (young males more likely to recidivate) but in other ways it would cut across (offense severity not tied to recidivism).
    
- Tension between retributivist goal of punishing the harshest crimes most severely and utilitarian goals of assigning people to most appropriate treatment to reduce recidivism. Judges, depending on their attitudes, may come to disagree with assessment of the risk tool.

### Race

- Race and risk are statistically correlated. Black offenders score higher on risk assessment instruments because they have more risk factors of recidivism and higher overall base rates of re-offending. Race is a stand-in for a whole host of structural inequality factors.
    
- Criminal history is also tied to race and is used extensively in sentencing guidelines and risk assessment. Criminal history is often one of the more important differentiating variables between White and Black defendants. Long list of reasons why Black citizens have longer criminal histories and more involvement with the criminal justice system.
    
- Criticisms of risk assessment focus on instrument bias and disparate impact. COMPAS incident. Even *unbiased* tools can promote disparity for reasons stated above (more risk factors and higher base rates).
    
- If risk assessment relies so much on criminal history (as sentencing guidelines do too) how much of a change is it really from the status quo? And how much change can we then subsequently expect? Empirical research is needed to clarify these issues.
    
- The consideration of risk, whether actuarial or criminal history, creates a disparate impact on minorities.
    
### Sentencing Guidelines and Risk Assessment

- There is incongruence between sentencing guidelines and actuarial risk assessment. Sentencing guidelines are meant to establish uniformity, reduce unwarranted disparity, and make sentencing consistent. This stands in stark contrast to actuarial risk assessment tools which differentiate between individuals on a variety of legal and extralegal factors -> antithetical to uniformity (individuals are sentenced the same despite personal characteristics). Both these policies have different goals.
    
- Some preliminary research from Virginia shows judges agree with risk assessment about 66% of the time. Higher risk scores generally associated with greater likelihood of custodial sentence. Other vignette based studies come to mixed results.
    
- Courtrooms are also multi-actor environments. Unclear how risk assessments will change the flow of court and other actors will react and how relationships will change.
