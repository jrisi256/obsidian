## Abstract

States have increasingly begun to rely on actuarial [[Risk assessment]] in the courtroom to inform criminal sentencing decisions. Despite this, we know little about the importance of risk for punishment decisions, particularly as the consideration of risk might contribute to racial/ethnic and gender disparity in sentencing. This chapter explores the implications of moving toward a sentencing model with an actuarial consideration of risk by putting risk assessment into a broader context of structured sentencing and judicial decision-making. It examines how legal and extra-legal factors mobilize to signal risk of re-offense at sentencing and discusses the possibilities of bias and disparate impact. A discussion on the relationship between sentencing guidelines and risk assessment policy follows, and recommendations for future lines of research are made.
