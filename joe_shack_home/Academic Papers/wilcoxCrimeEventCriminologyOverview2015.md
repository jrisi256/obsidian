## My notes

### Introduction

Traditional criminology is overwhelmingly offender-focused. Approaches to crime prevention often follow suit.

In contrast, crime-event criminology or environmental criminology focuses on the spatial and temporal distribution of offending behavior. An offender is but one piece in a crime happening, the other important aspect being opportunity (victims, lack of guardians, coinciding of offenders and such targets and lack of guardians in time and space) -> account for non-random spatial and temporal distribution of crime.

Some interesting policy implications -> fostering informal surveillance through smart architectural design and planning (i.e. clear sight lines), enhancing formal surveillance (police, more video surveillance), holding owners more accountable for law violations on their property.

### Origins

* Ronald Clarke in Great Britain finds offenders make rational choices about which crimes to engage in depending on environmental cues corresponding to risk, reward, and effort.

* SUNY-Albany found those most likely to be victimized (men, younger adults, African-Americans) were part of demographic groups that typically had lifestyles associated with greater environmental exposure to opportunity for victimization.

* See [[cohenSocialChangeCrime1979]] who formalized [[Routine activity]] theory.

* Brantingham couple focused on physical and social characteristics of environments conducive to crime -> environmental design more generally.

* Combining these methods to develop multiple levels of analysis -> victims, places, streets, and neighborhoods.

### Criticisms

* Concerns over victim-blaming.
* Theory and policy implications didn’t address root causes of crime, merely dealing with symptoms -> displace crimes.
* Conservative because it was supportive of increasing state-based crime control.

#### Rebuttals

- Further research has shown the policy implementations of the theory don’t merely displace crime.

- These proposals are more easily implemented in today’s current political climate

- Not conservative in the sense they’re incongruous with concerns about social justice and social context. They’re preventive policies and are neutral/non-punitive towards offenders. More focused on creating situations where offenders don’t perceive opportunity to offend (rather than arresting/incarcerating them).
 
- Can be used to protect victims.
