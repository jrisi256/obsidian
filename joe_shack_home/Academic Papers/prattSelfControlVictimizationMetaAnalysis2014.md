## Abstract

A consequential development in victimization theory and research was the idea that individuals with low self-control self-select into the various risky behaviors that may ultimately result in their victimization. To establish the empirical status of the self-control–victimization link, we subjected this body of work to a meta-analysis. Our multilevel analyses of 311 effect size estimates drawn from 66 studies (42 independent data sets) indicate that self-control is a modest yet consistent predictor of victimization. The results also show that the effect of self-control is significantly stronger when predicting non-contact forms of victimization (e.g., online victimization) and is significantly reduced in studies that control directly for the risky behaviors that are assumed to mediate the self-control–victimization link. We also note that the studies assessing self-control and victimization are not representative of victimization research as a whole, with intimate partner violence (IPV), violence against women, and child abuse being severely underrepresented. We conclude that future research should continue to examine the causal processes linking self-control to victimization, how self-control shapes victims’ coping responses to their experience, and whether self-control matters in contexts where individuals may have limited autonomy over the behavioral routines that put them at risk for victimization.

## My notes

### Introduction

* Most criminological research shows a strong correlation between someone committing a crime and the same person being a victim of crime. Recent work has attempted to integrate self-control into victimization theories and broader criminological theories.
  
* Most theorists in this area have focused in on self-control ([[Social control theory|social control]]) and have tested if those with low self-control are at heightened risk of victimization.
  
* [[Routine activity]] theories really began the focus on victimization and how certain behaviors in certain contexts made certain individuals more at risk of being victimized. Routine activities argued that variations in risk of victimization were rooted in broader ecological processes beyond any one individual's control.
  
* Self-control theorists argued, because of low self-control, these individuals were self-selecting into the risky situations. 

### Data and Methods

**Hypotheses**
* What is the effect of self-control on victimization?
  
* How is the effect moderated by methodological choices made by researchers?
	* **Type of victimization**: **direct-contact** (violent victimization or theft) or **non-contact victimization** (property damage, fraud, stalking, cyber victimization).
		* Broke it down even further into **violent victimization**, **property victimization**, **sexual victimization**, **general victimization** (e.g., studies that combine everything), **cyber victimization**, or **other non-violent victimization** (e.g., fraud, threats, stalking, bullying, emotional/psychological harm).
	* **Intervening Mechanisms**
		* Are the causal mechanisms which self-control is supposed to set into motion measured?  Does the study control for other variables which are supposed to be protective factors?
			* **Offending**, **deviant peers**, **unstructured routines**, **social bonds**, and **gang membership**.
	* Self-control measured attitudinally.
	* Do models **control for prior victimization**?
	* Is the study **longitudinal?**
	* Is the study **multivariate** or **bivariate**?
	* What's the nature of the sample?
		* **School sample**, **general population**, or **criminal/high-risk**?
		* **Mixed gender**, **male**, or **female**.
		* **Racially heterogeneous** or **racially homogeneous**? **Juvenile** or **adult**? **USA** or **non-USA**?
* Use [[Multilevel modeling|multilevel modeling]] where level 1 units correspond to effect size estimates and level 2 units correspond to the studies in question.
			  
* What areas have not been explored yet?
	* How does self-control shape coping mechanisms after being victimized?
	* How well does self-control work as a predictor variable when autonomy is limited? E.g., age, institutional settings, etc. What about in situations where autonomy is perceived to be limited? E.g., intimate partner violence.

### Results

* **Table 1** -> The overall effect size is significant, and it is predictably larger for studies which estimated bivariate models vs. multivariate models.
  
* **Table 2** -> The general trend indicates that self-control is fairly robust to a wide variety of research designs. There are some important considerations though.
	* Self-control is a weak predictor of **direct-contact victimization**.
	* When considering **intervening mechanisms/protective factors**, self-control becomes a a weak predictor of victimization.
		* Suggests self-control may not have a direct impact on victimization. Its effects are largely indirect.
	* When **controlling for prior victimization**, self-control becomes a weak predictor of victimization.
	* Surprisingly, self-control is a stronger predictor in **male samples** and a weaker predictor in **non-USA samples**.
	  
* **Table 3** -> When only considering multivariate analyses, the results largely replicate (although the differences for male and non-USA samples disappear).

### Discussion

* Self-control is a consistent, but modest, predictor of victimization.
* Its effects on victimization are likely indirect.
* Self-control is more robust when predicting non-contact forms of victimization.

### Limitations

* "... studies assessing sexual assault victimization and intimate partner violence are severely underrepresented... and studies addressing more broadly violence against women, family violence, and child abuse within this theoretical framework are completely absent. Accordingly, self-control theory cannot assume the flavor of generality..." #quote (pg. 4 PDF, pg. 90 document).
  
* All but one study relied on self-reports of victimization.
