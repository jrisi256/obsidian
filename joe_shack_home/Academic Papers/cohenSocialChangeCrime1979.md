## Abstract

In this paper we present a "routine activity approach" for analyzing crime rate trends and cycles. Rather than emphasizing the characteristics of offenders, with this approach we concentrate upon the circumstances in which they carry out predatory criminal acts. Most criminal acts require convergence in space and time of likely offenders, suitable targets and the absence of capable guardians against crime. Human ecological theory facilitates an investigation into the way in which social structure produces this convergence, hence allowing illegal activities to feed upon the legal activities of everyday life. In particular, we hypothesize that the dispersion of activities away from households and families increases the opportunity for crime and thus generates higher crime rates. A variety of data is presented in support of the hypothesis, which helps explain crime rate trends in the United States 1947-1974 as a byproduct of changes in such variables as labor force participation and single-adult households.

## My notes

### Introduction

Present [[Routine activity]] theory. Concentrates upon the circumstances in which offenders carry out crime. Specifically they claim criminal acts require a convergence in space and time of likely offenders, suitable targets, and the absence of capable guardians. Hypothesize the dispersion of activities away from households and families increases the opportunity for crime.

The lack of any one of these 3 elements is sufficient to prevent completion of direct-contact crime. The convergence in time and space of these 3 elements can lead to large increases in crime even when the structural conditions don’t change or improve. That is, if the proportion of motivated offenders or even suitable targets were to remain stable, changes in routine activity can alter the likelihood of their convergence in time and space thus creating more opportunities for crime to occur.

Trying to solve a bit of a paradox. Urban violent crime rates have increased despite the improvement of structural conditions which produce crime. Connected to the change in USA citizens’ routine activities schedule after WWII → how we get food, shelter, leisure, work, social interaction, and sex greatly changes. Aren’t at the house as often. More women working. More single-person households.

“... we do not examine why individuals or groups are inclined criminally, but rather we take criminal inclination as a given and examine the manner in which the spatio-temporal organization of social activities helps people to translate their criminal inclinations into action… interdependence between the structure of illegal activities and the organization of everyday sustenance activities...” #quote 

### Background

Amos Hawley -> Temporality very important to crime:
1) rhythm, periodicity with which events occur.
2) tempo, the number of events per unit of time (number of criminal violations per day on a given street.
3) timing, coordination among different activities which are more or less interdependent, how much do offender’s and victim’s rhythms overlap.

Suitable targets can involve a variety of factors (material/symbolic desirability of person or property, physical properties of the property make it more/less easy to steal, architectural/environmental design, locks, etc.).

Strong variations in predatory crime rates from hour to hour, day to day, month to month.

### Empirical Implications

Much more likely to be victimized by strangers away from home, lone victimization much more likely, expensive and more movable items such as vehicles and lightweight electronic appliances have the highest risk of being stolen. Those living in single-person households and who work and play outside the home have the highest chances of being victimized. Those who are handicapped also have higher victimization rates. Higher rates of burglary happening during the daytime (less people at home).

“It is ironic that the very factors which increase the opportunity to enjoy the benefits of life also may increase the opportunity for predatory violations… Indeed the opportunity for crime appears to be enmeshed in the opportunity structure for legitimate activities to such an extent that it might be very difficult to root out substantial amounts of crime without modifying much of our way of life. Rather than assuming that crime is simply an indicator of social breakdown, one might take it as a byproduct of freedom and prosperity as they manifest themselves in the routine activities of everyday life.” #quote 

### Class discussion notes

The pattern of increased female labor force participation continued to increase though the 1980's but yet property crime declined. Felson claims this is because of the increase in guardianship coupled with this seeming increase in suitable victims (abandoned houses, single-adult households, etc.).

Darrell thinks a substitution effect is happening and is far more important to explaining crime trends. No empirical evidence of this increased guardianship but also just harder to buy increased guardianship could increase so quickly in such a short period of time. Drug dealing, credit card fraud/credit fraud, welfare fraud.

Burglary and robbery are pretty random. Why do certain houses which are abandoned get robbed but others don't (similarly abandoned)?

What are the factors which make you a more susceptible target? Some problems because it can very quickly turn into victim blaming or at least construed that way. Some extensions of the guardianship stuff are also very broad (who and what is/isn't a guardian?). How do you measure guardianship? (gun ownership, dog ownership).

Of course, the very obvious critiques that it ignores the individual and what they bring to the situation (we interactively create our opportunities after all)... sociologists though tend to like it because it emphasizes the structure and situation rather than the individual. I mean, I see the appeal. Particularly it's interesting to think about from an urban planning perspective and how to build environments.

Not very useful for non-street crime. Corporate crime, terrorism, gambling.
