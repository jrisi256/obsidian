## Abstract

This article reveals the grounds on which individuals form perceptions of disorder. Integrating ideas about implicit bias and statistical discrimination with a theoretical framework on neighborhood racial stigma, our empirical test brings together personal interviews, census data, police records, and systematic social observations situated within some 500 block groups in Chicago. Observed disorder predicts perceived disorder, but racial and economic context matter more. As the concentration of minority groups and poverty increases, residents of all races perceive heightened disorder even after we account for an extensive array of personal characteristics and independently observed neighborhood conditions. Seeing disorder appears to be imbued with social meanings that go well beyond what essentialist theories imply, generating self-reinforcing processes that may help account for the perpetuation of urban racial inequality.

## My notes

### Research Question

* Is seeing disorder only a matter of objective level cues in the environment? Or is disorder filtered through a reasoning based on stigmatized groups and disreputable areas?
  
* Assess the variables which predict when an individual's perceptions of disorder rise to the level of them defining it as a problem. Assess how racial/ethnic and socioeconomic variables at the neighborhood level shape perceptions above and beyond the objective, observable conditions of disorder.

* Criticize [[kellingBrokenWindowsPolice1982]] by assuming that disorder is unambiguous and natural in meaning. People can observe the same set of objective conditions but due to other factors, they may or may not perceive of the environment as being problematic.
  
* Our latent, implicit biases against minority groups, particularly Black Americans, can creep up in these situations despite having no personal animosity towards minority groups. They operate at the level of the subconscious, subtly influencing our conscious thoughts -> see studies on how in simulations people are quicker to shoot Black offenders (among Black and White sample members) -> everybody, including minority groups, are exposed to these cultural stereotypes.

* The stigmatization of neighborhoods.

### Data and Methods

* Neighborhood survey of residents in Chicago.
* Asked questions about residential perceptions of disorder: How much of a problems is litter, trash, broken glass, graffiti, drinking in public, etc.
* Also measure individual-level characteristics such as race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status ([[Principal Component Analysis]]) of education, income, and occupational prestige, sex, marital status, home ownership, residential mobility, and age.
* Measure at the census-block level: poverty, density, proportion Black and Latino, police-recorded number of violent offenses.
* Use [[systematic social observation]]. Drove an SUV down every street in the sample of census block groups. Video recordings were made of the streets as they drove by. Two trained observers took notes. Then looked at the tapes and came to consensus on how to measure several variables of disorder.
	* Physical disorder -> defined by 10 items such as presence/absence of beer bottles, garbage, etc.
	* Social disorder -> Presence of absence of people loitering, public consumption of alcohol.
	* Physical decay -> vacant houses, physical deterioration.
	* Commercial building security.
	* Alcohol and tobacco advertising.
	* Bars and liquor stores.

Use [[Multilevel modeling|multilevel modeling]] to estimate within-neighborhood and between-neighborhood views of disorder:
1) Between-neighborhood model -> used to estimate the neighborhood-specific intercept (for disorder I assume). It is a function of all the neighborhood-level variables as well as the adjusted mean perceived disorder score (mean of everyone's disorder perceptions for their neighborhood).
2) Within-neighborhood (person level) model -> Estimate an individual's perception of disorder for a given neighborhood as a function of that individual's characteristics.

### Results

#### Individual level

* Women tend to perceive more disorder than men.
* Ethnic/racial minorities, older people, and separate/divorced people tend to perceive less disorder.
* Important to acknowledge this is among people living in the same block group.

### Neighborhood level

* How are perceptions of disorder influenced by neighborhood-level characteristics?
* Perceptions of physical and social disorder predict perceptions of disorder. Same for physical decay. Other variables did not.
  
* However, once the social context variables are added: the objective-level variables capturing actual levels of disorder lose significance or are greatly diminished in effect size. Percent minority and percent poverty are highly significant and have large effect sizes.
  
* The effect of neighborhood racial composition was independent of the observer's race/ethnicity. Black respondents were not significantly more or less likely than Whites to view predominately Black neighborhoods as high in disorder.
	* However, as the percent Black of the neighborhood increases, and if the respondent is Latino, they are significantly more likely than White respondents to perceive higher amounts of disorder.

* Replicate their findings on a separate survey of community leaders in Chicago. The effect sizes are greatly reduced. I think it is because they also include as a variable residents' perceived disorder.
  
* Results cannot be explained by individual-level racial prejudice because Black respondents were just as likely as White respondents to have higher levels of perceived disorder as % Black increased.
  
* Unfortunately, reducing levels of disorder may not reduce people's perceptions of it.
