## My notes

### Introduction

* What are the non-biological reasons people engage in delinquency? This paper will be arguing sometimes it is social structures which generate delinquency in people. Two important elements of social structure.
	* Culturally defined goals, purposes, and interests.
	* Culturally defined acceptable modes of achieving those goals.

### Description of theory

* On one polar end is a society in which one is only limited by the technical means of achieving one’s goals ([[Rapture]]). There are no institutional norm considerations. On the other polar end is one in which activities originally conceived of as solely instrumental become ritualized and become ends in of themselves. Stability is ensured while change is stifled.
  
* Equilibrium is maintained so long as individuals 1) achieve success 2) in the prescribed ways. Aberrant conduct emerges as a dissociation between the defined goals and the means of obtaining said goals.
  
* This essay focuses on groups or individuals who share in the same goals but not in the means to achieve those goals. Certain social structures may put so much emphasis on the goals that antisocial behavior develops since individuals no longer care about the proper means to achieve those goals and will only care about what’s expedient. This leads to [[anomie]] or social disintegration.
	* “The emphasis on the goal has so attenuated the satisfactions from sheer participation…” #quote 

### Five typologies

* **Conformity** is an individual who accepts the goals and the means of obtaining them.
* **Innovation** is when an individual accepts the goals but NOT the means.
* **Ritualism** is when an individual accepts the means of obtaining “success” or a goal but following the rules becomes a rule itself regardless if it results in obtaining the goal.
* **Retreatism** is when an individual rejects the goals and the means of obtaining said goals.
* **Rebellion** is when an individual seeks to institutionalize new procedures for achieving new goals. It wants to change rather than accommodate.
* People move in and out of these roles depending on the activity. Claims role 1 is most common. Ensures stability and continuity of society.
* Role 4 is least common. Calls these people psychotics, pariahs, drug addicts. Interesting categorization. Sometimes people can’t follow the rules and obtain the culturally prescribed goals. Creates dissonance as the individual wants to follow the rules but also wants to obtain the goals in illegitimate ways now. Individuals who have internalized the prohibitions so strongly and yet are so unable to achieve their goals simply drop out. Eliminate the goals and the means.
* In all other cases when an individual cannot obtain success due to the inaccessibility of legitimate means, roles 3, 4, and 5 are also possible. Depending on the individual and the background will determine which role they fall into.

### Full explanation of the theory

* It can become a *normal* response to a situation where the emphasis on success has been so absorbed but there is little access to legitimate means of achieving the success. If the only available labor in the area is low-paid, low-prestige, unskilled, manual labor, it cannot compete (due to the emphasis on success) with the relatively higher income which can result from vice.
  
* Thus such antisocial behavior is called forth by the values of the culture and the class structure which involves differential access to legitimate opportunity. The lack of integration of means and ends for certain groups will then produce more antisocial behavior.
	* “On the one hand, they are asked to orient their conduct toward the prospect of accumulating wealth and on the other, they are largely denied effective opportunities to do so institutionally.” #quote 
	* “High frequency of deviant behavior isn’t generated \[solely\] by lack of opportunity or by exaggerated emphasis on monetary success. It is only when a culture extols, above all else, certain common symbols of success for the population at large while its social structure rigorously restricts or eliminates access to approved modes of acquiring those symbols for a considerable part of the same population that antisocial behavior ensues.“ An implication of this is if each class had different goals, wouldn’t be an issue. But because all classes have the same goal, this is an issue. #quote 
	  
* Therefore the tenuous connection between poverty and crime. Poverty is less highly correlated with crime in southeastern Europe vs. the United States. The story of upward mobility in those areas is less prevalent in those parts of Europe. Thus poverty + limited opportunity alone cannot explain crime because the missing component (in Europe) which is present here in the USA is the  commonly shared (across class lines) symbols of success. Europe, apparently, differential class symbols of success.
