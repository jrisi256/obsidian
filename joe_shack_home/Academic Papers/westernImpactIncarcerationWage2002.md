## Abstract

A life course perspective on crime indicates that incarceration can disrupt key life transitions. Life course analysis of occupations finds that earnings mobility depends on stable employment in career jobs. These two lines of research thus suggest that incarceration reduces ex-inmates' access to the steady jobs that usually produce earnings growth among young men. Consistent with this argument, evidence for slow wage growth among ex-inmates is provided by analysis of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Because incarceration is so prevalent-one-quarter of black non-college males in the survey were interviewed between 1979 and 1998 while in prison or jail-the effect of imprisonment on individual wages also increases aggregate race and ethnic wage inequality.

## Mechanisms

* Incarceration is a key turning point which disrupts the life-course. It imposes opportunity costs on how convicts might have otherwise spent their time developing themselves.
	* **Incarceration is stigmatizing**. --> Signals employers this person is untrustworthy.
	* **Incarceration erodes job skills**. --> Time spent out of employment prevents the acquisition of skills which they otherwise might have attained. Behaviors learned in prison are counterproductive for finding gainful employment outside of prison.
	* **Incarceration erodes social networks**. --> Connections to stable employers and family worsen, ties to gangs strengthen, the size of one's social networks and the number of weak ties is much smaller.

## Predictions

* Incarceration reduces the level of earnings.
* Incarceration causes individuals to experience slower wage growth vs. if they hadn't been incarcerated.

## Survey vs. Administrative data

* Earnings data from unemployment insurance records understate the incomes of those in day labor or other informal work.
* If earnings are only observed for ex-inmates who gets jobs in the formal economy, analysis may include just those with successful experiences of re-integration. The negative post-release effect would be understated.
* If ex-convicts with off-the-books incomes are assumed to have no earnings, incarceration's effects will be overstated.
* Administrative data does not often have education data.
* This study uses the [[National Longitudinal Survey of Youth]] from 1983 - 1998. About 50,000 observations so roughly 3,000 individuals.
	* Were individuals interviewed in prison or jail? (Under-measures prison/jail spells less than 12 months).
	* Asks individuals if they have ever been incarcerated and if incarceration was ever a reason for not seeking work --> only asked in a few interview waves.

## Model

* Outcome variable is log hourly wags.
* Independent variables are the log of age, a dummy variable if an individual had ever served time in prison or jail, a dummy variable if an individual was currently incarcerated.
* Includes an interaction term of log age and if an individual had ever served time in prison or jail.
* Includes year, years of education, and years of education interacted with year to capture declining wages in general for men with low-education.
* Uses [[ordinary least squares]]. Results robust to different model specifications.

### Controlling for selection into incarceration

* **Approach 1** --> Slew of controls including race, work experience, cognitive ability, drug use, marriage, criminal history, union membership, industry of work.
* **Approach 2** --> Individual-level [[fixed effects]].
* **Approach 3** --> I do not really understand how he constructs this sample, but he constructs a sample of non-incarcerated prior felons (is the claim).

## Results

* Incarceration reduces hourly wages.
* Incarceration has negative interaction effects with age indicating that incarcerated men have a smaller slope (slower wage growth) compared to non-incarcerated men.
	* For models estimated only on Black respondents, the effect was smallest (meaning Black incarcerated men compared to Black non-incarcerated men, experienced the least decline in wage growth among all racial groups). Black individuals (as a group) are punished for the relatively high incarceration rates of their group?
* Period effects (year) are very important as they show that low-educated minority men have very poor wage growth during this time period.
* Incarceration caused wage inequality to grow ***modestly*** within each racial group (larger coefficients of variation) and caused wage inequality to grow ***modestly*** across racial groups (comparing difference in mean wages for Whites vs. Blacks and Whites vs. Hispanics). Created predictions of wages using observed values of incarceration and then setting all values of incarceration to 0.
