## My notes

* The routines of social intercourse in established settings allow us to size up others without much special thought. First appearances allow us to anticipate their social category and attributes, stereotyping and assumptions. They soon become normative expectations.
  
* We construct a virtual social identity which may or may not be the same as their actual social identity. Stigma is when the person possesses an attribute which makes them lesser than they otherwise normally would be for someone in that category causing gaps in virtual vs. actual social identity.
  
* What makes something a stigma though depends on the context (some jobs are seen as appropriate given a certain educational level while the same job may make one seem like a failure if they held it while holding a high degree of education). Stigma is a relationship between attribute and stereotype.
  
* Stigma can be physical, a social trait, or group-based (race, religion, nation). Stigmatized individuals are treated as not human, reduce their life chances, construct theories to explain the inferiority and our hostile actions, attribute other attributes to the person with the stigma not stemming from the original stigma (e.g. the blind have super smell, shout at blind people) -> can sometimes get a self-fulfilling prophecy if people with stigmas get defensive and act in the way we anticipate.
  
* Some hold their stigma as not stigma (see very orthodox Jewish people, strange choice for an example). Others do see their stigma as stigma and are deeply ashamed of it. There is a lack of acceptance, and oftentimes they look inward and echo the denial as being warranted. Various ways of dealing with it (fix the stigma, learn and master activities of the normals, use the stigma for secondary gains). Passage on how people with stigma see it as a way of learning through suffering, don’t really see themselves as lesser than normals.
  
* Normals and stigmatized may try to arrange to not have to interact with each other on a daily basis. Particularly damaging for stigmatized. Stigmatized people are afraid of… being stigmatized. Also quite anxiety-inducing since new situations will make them unsure of how they’re going to be reacted to, how others really feel about them, self-conscious about their actions. Mental health patients can become afraid to show sharp emotions, people rushing to help a one-legged person who fell. Stigmatized people can then feel exposed and like they have a lack of privacy. People stare, take it upon themselves to think they can talk about the stigma.
  
* Normals struggle too. Should we be more or less sympathetic? How should we read their defensiveness? “...infinite regress of mutual consideration…” Stigmatized persons must become adept at navigating these situations. Amongst other people with the same stigma, group solidarity and subcultures form. #quote 
  
* Stigmatized groups often have normal representatives (or even stigmatized representatives) who work on their behalf as liaisons to other normals about the things they want done and to have happen. Ideologies are formed: complaints, aspirations, politics, enemies, success stories, atrocity stories, mistreatment by normals, some diversity of opinion as well. Sometimes representatives become emblematic or the prime example of that type of stigma. They become known as that stigma. Leads to a certain professionalization of their representative work.

* As briefly mentioned, there are other representatives who are normals who are accepted by the stigmatized community. They due to some life circumstances (sometimes tragic) know about the intimate lives of those with the stigma. Sometimes just due to their jobs (nurses, physical therapists, bartender for prostitutes), family members (of course the stigma can spread leaving to the termination of the connection), a cult of stigmatization can occur making everyone uncomfortable.
  
* Moral career -> People who have a particular stigma tend to have similar learning experiences and similar changes in the conception of self. Learns the standpoint of the normals, learns what it socially means to acquire such a disability. Learn what their category is so to speak, can be sudden ruptures in life (go to school, try to date, look for a job), can be with you since birth, can be systematic exposure, can become stigmatized later in life (may lose your pre-stigma associates), can lose your stigma and have to transition to normality.

* Those with stigmas eventually learn the full humanity of those who share in their stigma, unlearning the associations of the normal world.
