## Abstract

The theory of [[anomie]] has undergone two major phases of development, as exemplified by the work of [[Durkheim]] and [[Merton]]. In this paper a third phase is outlined. As currently stated, the theory focuses on pressures toward deviant behavior arising from discrepancies between cultural goals and approved modes of access to them. It focuses, in short, upon variations in the availability of legitimate means. One may also inquire, however, about variations in access to success-goals by illegitimate means. The latter emphasis may be detected in the work of Shaw, McKay, Sutherland, and others in the "cultural transmission" and "[[differential association]]" tradition. By taking into account differentials in access to success-goals both by legitimate and by illegitimate means, the theory of anomie may be extended to include seemingly unrelated theories of deviant behavior now contained in the traditional literature of criminology.

## My notes

### Succinct Summary

* Cloward begins by stating Merton believed the distribution of adaptations (e.g. retreatists, innovators, conformists) in a particular society is the result of two things. The first is the extent to which the individual feels pressure (imposed by the social structure in regards to achieving success-goals and how blocked off from legitimate opportunity they are), and the second is how internalized are the prohibitions against the use of illegitimate means to achieve success-goals (i.e. values).
  
* From this starting point, Cloward says a third variable needs to be introduced which is the differential in availability of illegitimate means. Cloward makes the point that not all unsatisfied or anomic individuals are going to have an equal opportunity to satisfy themselves in illegitimate ways similar to how legitimate means are also unevenly spread throughout society. Stated more plainly, if somebody decides to engage in deviant or criminal activities, their ability to do so is going to be different based upon who they are.
  
* Cloward goes on to state he means two things by means (both legitimate and illegitimate). The first structure implied by means are learning structures. One must first learn how to commit illegitimate (or legitimate) acts. The second structure implied by means are opportunity structures. This represents how often one has the opportunity to employ what one has learned (either in legitimate or illegitimate settings). Just as one can go to business school and never get the chance to practice it because they don’t get hired, one can learn to be a thief but not have the opportunity to practice it.
  
* Cloward concludes by stating his theory bridges the gap between Sutherland’s theories which emphasize learning structures and Merton’s theories which emphasize access to legitimate opportunities while expanding upon Merton by stressing access to illegitimate opportunities. Cloward’s expansion also helps to make sense of Shaw and McKay’s social disorganization theory where it’s clarified that slums aren’t actually socially disorganized, but they are organized in such a way so as to promote learning structures and opportunity structures conducive to crime and deviance, i.e. there is greater access to illegitimate means. While not exploring this point further, Cloward emphasizes access to illegitimate means will not only be determined by place but also on other aspects of one’s social identity (e.g. social class, race/ethnicity, and gender).

### Introduction

* **Durkheim** -> Unlimited aspirations and breakdown of regulatory norms. Individuals’ aspirations must be regulated and unlimited otherwise they’re continually unsatisfied. So in moments of great crisis as well as great prosperity, individuals feel despair since their aspirations have either completely bottomed out or know no upper bound.
  
* **Merton** -> Goals and norms/acceptable means vary independently of one another which can lead to a lack of integration. When achievement of the goals is stressed above all else, this is one way in which a lack of integration can occur.
	* This is anomie -> “acute disjunction between cultural norms and goals and the socially structured capacities of members of the group to act in accord with them.” #quote #definition 
	* And then, “when certain common success-goals for the population at large are stressed while the social structure rigorously restricts access to approved modes of reaching these goals for a considerable part of the population then deviant behavior will ensue.” #quote 

  ### Expansion of theory

* **Illegitimate Means** -> Merton saw the distribution of adaptations to the culture principally as the consequence of: 1) Extent of pressure and 2) Values or internalized prohibitions governing the use of illegitimate means. Values channel or direct behavior by limiting the choice of deviant adaptations for persons.
  
* Cloward is arguing a third variable which should be considered is 3) **Differentials in availability of illegitimate means**. Simply because one feels unsatisfied and feels as if they cannot make it legitimately does not mean they can then turn illegitimate. Much like how legitimate opportunities are unequally distributed and limited so are illegitimate opportunities.
	* Two things implied by means: 1) Learning structures 2) Opportunity structures (moments to employ what one’s learned). Applies in both legitimate and illegitimate settings.

### Others tapping into this idea

* Sutherland made the distinction between learning structures and opportunity structures. Never really fully explored the opportunity structures.
  
* Shaw and McKay -> Identified that access to criminal roles depends upon stable associations with others from whom the necessary values and skills may be learned. They were describing deviant learning structures However, they didn’t really think about their data in this way because they viewed slums as inherently disorganized. Sutherland was among the first to see there was a stable pattern of interactions and human arrangements within criminogenic slums -> differential social organization.
  
* Whyte and Kobrin: Whyte took it in a bit of a different direction from Sutherland. individuals in slums who participate in stable illicit enterprise do not constitute a separate or isolated segment of the community but are closely integrated with occupants in conventional roles. Comprises a single, stable structure which organizes the life of the community.
	* Kobrin expands upon this to describe a typology of delinquency areas based on the variations in the relationship between conventional and deviant societies. On one end of the spectrum, you’ll find structural integration and reciprocal participation by each in the value system of the other. “Leaders of illegal enterprises frequently maintain membership in such conventional institutions as churches and political parties…” The other end of the spectrum is when the relationship between carriers of deviant values and carriers of conventional values breaks down. Implicit in the integrated society are learning and opportunity structures for crime, not in the second society.
	  
* “... illegal opportunity structures tend to emerge in lower-class areas only when stable patterns of accommodation and integration arise between carriers of conventional and deviant values. Where these values remain unorganized and in open conflict, opportunities for stable criminal role performance are more or less limited.” #quote 
  
* Briefly mention how race, gender, age, kinship can also affect the learning and opportunity structures. Of course class plays a big role as well.
* Lack of access to legitimate means and access to illegitimate means -> where means are broken down by learning structures and opportunity/performance structures.
* Control access to illegitimate means and boost access to legitimate means.
