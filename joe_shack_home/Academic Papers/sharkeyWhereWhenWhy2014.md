## Abstract

The literature on [[neighborhood]] effects frequently is evaluated or interpreted in relation to the question, “Do neighborhoods matter?” We argue that this question has had a disproportionate influence on the field and does not align with the complexity of theoretical models of neighborhood effects or empirical findings that have arisen from the literature. In this article, we focus on empirical work that considers how different dimensions of individuals' residential contexts become salient in their lives, how contexts influence individuals' lives over different time frames, how individuals are affected by social processes operating at different scales, and how residential contexts influence the lives of individuals in heterogeneous ways. In other words, we review research that examines where, when, why, and for whom do residential contexts matter. Using the large literature on neighborhoods and educational and cognitive outcomes as an example, the research we review suggests that any attempt to reduce the literature to a single answer about whether neighborhoods matter is misguided. We call for a more flexible study of context effects in which theory, measurement, and methods are more closely aligned with the specific mechanisms and social processes under study.

### Introduction

* An individual's neighborhood matters in different ways at different times.
* *Does neighborhood matter?* is a misguided question.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X5R3JQVK?page=27.1&annotation=W8XWD6A7) “different dimensions of individuals’ residential contexts become salient in their lives, how contexts influence individuals’ lives over different time frames, how individuals are affected by social processes operating at different scales, and how residential contexts influence the lives of individuals in heterogeneous ways.” ([Sharkey and Faber, 2014, p. 27.1](zotero://select/library/items/JI4NLE7P)) 
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X5R3JQVK?page=27.1&annotation=5IW2DJ8N) “the research we review suggests that any attempt to reduce the literature to a single answer about whether neighborhoods matter is misguided.” ([Sharkey and Faber, 2014, p. 27.1](zotero://select/library/items/JI4NLE7P))
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X5R3JQVK?page=27.4&annotation=IDZTBDB5) “a single neighborhood is experienced in different ways by groups of individuals who have lived there for varying lengths of time, and who spend their time within the neighborhood in different ways and in their own spaces, carving out unique social worlds from the common environment that surrounds them (Sharkey 2006). This perspective on neighborhood effects moves away from the question of whether neighborhoods matter and moves toward the questions of when, where, why, and for whom do residential contexts matter.” ([Sharkey and Faber, 2014, p. 27.4](zotero://select/library/items/JI4NLE7P))
* Yes neighborhoods matter. The important question is, "How, when, why and for whom?"
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X5R3JQVK?page=27.3&annotation=NSVG5FTI) “Do neighborhoods matter?”—carries the implication that it is possible to condense the literature on neighborhood effects to a point where one might arrive at an answer (Small & Feldman 2012). To reach an answer to this question requires a simplification of theory and empirical findings that does not correspond with the complexity of theoretical models or empirical evidence relating to the relationships between individuals and the contexts in which they live.” ([Sharkey and Faber, 2014, p. 27.3](zotero://select/library/items/JI4NLE7P))
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X5R3JQVK?page=27.8&annotation=89B3E43R) “However, the tremendous variation in program effects arising from broadly similar programs provides a strong hint that the impact of assisted residential mobility is likely to depend on the local context in which the program is implemented.” ([Sharkey and Faber, 2014, p. 27.8](zotero://select/library/items/JI4NLE7P))

### Too much emphasis on causality and over-controlling

* The focus on selection bias and causal inference has led to a neglect of other areas of substantive interest. #causal_inference_skeptical
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X5R3JQVK?page=27.2&annotation=PEVYFM59) “However, we believe that the primary focus on the methodological problem of [[selection bias]] has led to a dearth of research on the mechanisms through which neighborhood inequality is linked with the outcomes of individuals (Sampson 2008).” ([Sharkey and Faber, 2014, p. 27.2](zotero://select/library/items/JI4NLE7P))
* This [[causal inference]] stuff has led us astray. It has blinded us to how connected various aspects of the social environment are.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X5R3JQVK?page=27.3&annotation=DCS373KL) “We argue that much of the research designed to isolate the effects of neighborhoods from the effects of other social contexts has overlooked the ways in which different dimensions of individuals’ social environments are linked together in space and time (Entwisle 2007, Sampson” ([Sharkey and Faber, 2014, p. 27.3](zotero://select/library/items/JI4NLE7P))
* Be careful not to control for everything!
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X5R3JQVK?page=27.11&annotation=AEDKASFJ) “By attempting to isolate the effect of neighborhoods from the effect of other relevant social contexts such as families and schools, researchers ignore that these contexts are tightly linked together in ways that extend over time and across generations of family members (Entwisle 2007).” ([Sharkey and Faber, 2014, p. 27.11](zotero://select/library/items/JI4NLE7P))

### Too much emphasis on defining neighborhood

* It's, of course, important to understand what exactly a neighborhood is. On the other hand, any one single definition isn't really all that important. It's all contextual
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X5R3JQVK?page=27.2&annotation=FIA2QMQD) “devoted to adjudicating between different definitions and methods of operationalizing neighborhoods (Briggs 1997, Tienda 1991). Although conceptual precision is an important goal, the core ideas, theories, and claims made in the literature on neighborhood effects are broader than any single definition of a neighborhood (Burton et al. 1997, Chaskin 1997,” ([Sharkey and Faber, 2014, p. 27.2](zotero://select/library/items/JI4NLE7P))
* Neighborhoods aren't these static things.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X5R3JQVK?page=27.3&annotation=KQJ6WI2W) “The neighborhood, from this perspective, is not a static feature of individuals’ lives that is experienced in a uniform” ([Sharkey and Faber, 2014, p. 27.3](zotero://select/library/items/JI4NLE7P)) 

### Moving the field forward

* Focus on residential context and residential environment. More accurate terms and avoid the baggage of the term *neighborhood*.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X5R3JQVK?page=27.5&annotation=WWP7XTKZ) “Further, we argue that the terms residential context and residential environment are more useful in capturing the theoretical ideas that underlie the literature than the term neighborhood.” ([Sharkey and Faber, 2014, p. 27.5](zotero://select/library/items/JI4NLE7P))
* These provide the basis for the study of residential context effects. Americans are stratified along spatial lines, and this stratification reproduces inequality along a variety of dimensions.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X5R3JQVK?page=27.14&annotation=2KP8XMZ9) “The first claim is that the American system of stratification is organized, in part, along spatial lines. The second claim is that the spatial dimension of American inequality plays an important role in the maintenance and reproduction of inequality across multiple dimensions (Dreier et al. 2004, Massey” ([Sharkey and Faber, 2014, p. 27.14](zotero://select/library/items/JI4NLE7P))
* Introduce a [[Life course theory|life course perspective]]. Time is very important in understanding how neighborhoods evolve along with the people in them.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X5R3JQVK?page=27.14&annotation=NBF5B93L) “A clear conclusion that has emerged in the literature is that the importance of residential contexts cannot be understood without adopting a life course perspective (Elder 1998, Mare 2011, Sharkey 2013).” ([Sharkey and Faber, 2014, p. 27.14](zotero://select/library/items/JI4NLE7P))
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X5R3JQVK?page=27.14&annotation=EYZTJLNW) “Individuals’ residential environments are not experienced at a single point in time and then erased from their lives. Rather, there is strong evidence that the influence of the residential environment persists and accumulates, with consequences that extend over long periods of time and generations of families (Sampson et al. 2008, Sharkey & Elwert 2011, Wodtke et al. 2011)” ([Sharkey and Faber, 2014, p. 27.14](zotero://select/library/items/JI4NLE7P))

### Race

* White/black families have totally different contexts.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X5R3JQVK?page=27.9&annotation=C4BH5C73) “The common finding in this strand of research is that white families may experience spells of residence in high poverty communities, but these spells are typically temporary. For black American families, residence in poor or disadvantaged communities is much more stable, and persistent exposure to such communities is common.” ([Sharkey and Faber, 2014, p. 27.9](zotero://select/library/items/JI4NLE7P))

### Qualitative Research

* We need to do a better job of understanding heterogeneous neighborhood effects.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X5R3JQVK?page=27.15&annotation=WLFCQP9W) “from ethnographic accounts of how individuals and families respond to the environment that surrounds them. The literature exploring the responses of boys and girls to changes in the residential environment shows that girls often face unique challenges within violent, high-poverty contexts and may benefit more than boys from moving to less-disadvantaged neighborhoods (Clampet-Lundquist et al. 2011, Kling et al. 2005, Popkin et al. 2008, Sanbonmatsu et al. 2006).” ([Sharkey and Faber, 2014, p. 27.15](zotero://select/library/items/JI4NLE7P))
