## My notes

NJ implemented a police foot patrol initiative.

* Many experts and police chiefs were skeptical that it would reduce crime -> believed the evidence indicated it was not a useful way for police officers to spend their time.
  
* Patrol officers did not love the initiative because it would mean more work.
  
* When the program was evaluated, it was found that it did not reduce crime, but:
	* Residents felt more secure and a more favorable opinion of the police.
	* Police officers, themselves, also had higher morale, greater job satisfaction, and a more favorable attitude towards citizens.

Was the program a success? In one sense, no. In another sense, yes. While crime did not go down, people felt safer. Felt safer perhaps from being bothered by disorderly people? (Curious word choice). The police instilled a public order.

* Notes that this happened despite predominantly White officers patrolling predominantly Black neighborhoods.
  
* Police maintained order -> kept an eye on strangers and made sure disorderly regulars followed some public maintenance rules e.g., you can sit on stoops but you cannot lie down in the street, you could drink on side streets but not the main intersection, etc.
  
* This informal rule enforcement was done in conjunction with the regulars -> **police reinforce the informal social control mechanisms already in place in the community.**
  
* What was fine in one neighborhood may not be fine in another neighborhood.

People fear disorder in their neighborhood and people breaking the social norms of their neighborhood more than they fear violent crime. The authors also argue that disorder and crime are linked. The more disorder that is tolerated, the more disorder which will follow.

* Once you send a signal that *no one cares*, more and more people will act as if it were true.
  
* This disordered conduct can then lead to a breakdown in informal community social control. "The unchecked panhandler is, in effect, the first broken window". #quote 

* The area can then become a breeding ground for crime.

Argue that the elderly are right to be afraid of crime (despite having lowest victimization rate but highest rates of fear of crime) ->

* Less ability to defend themselves.
  
* Confrontations with disorderly people can be just as unnerving as actual crime.
  
* Low rates of victimization represent changes in their [[Routine activity]] to avoid becoming victims of crime.

The situation can lead to [[Legal cynicism|legal cynicism]] forming as the police cannot do much to change the character of the neighborhood. Officers may stereotype the neighborhood and the residents may grow to resent the police.

Why are we seeing this happen now on the scale we do in urban centers?
1. People are much more mobile.
2. Police, nowadays, are seen primarily as crime fighters rather than order maintainers. Speaks laudably about how the police used to rough up people to maintain the public order. #disagree 
	1. Also coincides with the crime wave of the 1960s.
	2. Led police to forget their role as maintainers of public order.

Officers in patrol cars are fundamentally different from police officers on foot. They are too far removed when in their vehicle.
* Argue people like and want to engage with police officers. When they are foot, this is much easier #disagree.

Police, by themselves, cannot recreate informal social control or conjure it up out of nothing. They can reinforce already existing informal social control, but they also must accommodate themselves to it.
* Raises a fundamental tension. Should the police officer enforce the established order of the neighborhood? Or of the state?
* We as a society have categories like vagrancy and public drunkenness to allow police officers the legal discretion to get rid of disorderly persons. 

### Quotes

* "The wish to decriminalize disreputable behavior that harms no one, and thus remove the ultimate sanction the police can employ to maintain neighborhood order, is we think a mistake. Arresting a single drunk or a single vagrant who has harmed no identifiable person seems unjust, and in a sense it is. But failing to do anything about a score of drunks or a hundred vagrants may destroy an entire community." #quote #disagree 
  
* "Of course, agencies other than the police could attend to the problems posed by drunks or mentally ill, but in most communities especially where the deinstitutionalization movement has been strong, they do not." #quote #question 
  
* "How do we ensure, in short, that the police do not become the agents of neighborhood bigotry? We can offer no wholly satisfactory answer to this important question. We are not confident that there is a satisfactory answer except to hope that by their selection, training, and supervision, the police will be inculcated with a clear sense of the outer limit of their discretionary authority. That limit, roughly, is this, the police exist to help regulate behavior, not to maintain the racial or ethnic purity of a neighborhood." #quote #question 
  
* What a wild paper. ''None of this is easily reconciled with any conception of due process or fair treatment. Since both residents and gang members are black, race is not a factor." #quote #disagree -> If we believe the police can only arrest wrongdoers, we limit their toolkit too much.

Authors argue that a more communal outlook as well as more cooperation between police and urban residents is necessary to improve the situation. Residents have more faith in the police to do the right thing and thus are willing to expand their toolkit.

Solutions;
* More effective policing interventions into places which require order maintenance.
* Community patrols and community watch groups.
* Having police officers or designated "representatives of the community" is important. People often do not intervene because they do not feel responsible nor are they sure if it is their place to intervene.
* Train police to not just be crime fighters. Do not deploy them just in high crime areas. Train them on how to manage *street life*.
