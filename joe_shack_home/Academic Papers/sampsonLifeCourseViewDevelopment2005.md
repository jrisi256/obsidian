## Abstract

In this article, the authors present a life-course perspective on crime and a critique of the developmental criminology paradigm. Their fundamental argument is that persistent offending and desistance—or trajectories of crime—can be meaningfully understood within the same theoretical framework, namely, a revised age graded theory of informal social control. The authors examine three major issues. First, they analyze data that undermine the idea that developmentally distinct groups of offenders can be explained by unique causal processes. Second, they revisit the concept of turning points from a time-varying view of key life events. Third, they stress the overlooked importance of human agency in the development of crime. The authors' [[Life course theory|life-course]] theory envisions development as the constant interaction between individuals and their environment, coupled with random developmental noise and a purposeful human agency that they distinguish from rational choice. Contrary to influential developmental theories in criminology, the authors thus conceptualize crime as an emergent process reducible neither to the individual nor the environment.

## My notes

Topics tackled:

1. They question Moffitt’s claims ([[moffittAdolescencelimitedLifecoursepersistentAntisocial1993]]) that there are developmentally distinct groups which have unique causes and trajectories. They find life-course desistance is the norm for all men and all crimes. The offender group typologies seem to have little predictive power for future offending.

2. The life-course perspective needs to incorporate turning points -> marriage, good employment, and entering the military (for the same man) seem to suggest some desistance -> use propensity score matching for some of the marriage stuff “... we see marriage not as a singular turning point but as a potential causal force in desistance that operates as a dynamic, time-varying process through time.” Relates to point 3. #quote 

3. Human agency needs to be taken more seriously from a social scientific perspective. People aren’t locked into trajectories. There is considerable heterogeneity which cannot be predicted. This is because humans exercise choice and construct their lives and associated meaning. Trajectories are not unfolding inevitability but instead continuous social reproduction. “... the men we studied were active participants in the process of going straight.” #quote 

4. Crime is more than a weakening of a social bond and desistance is more than the presence of a social bond. It’s a choice and in many ways criminals find themselves “desisting by default”.

5. In contrast to the myopic view of rational choice where we merely need to measure people’s preferences, we construct our preferences and take actions partly to discover and create preferences we currently don’t have.

6. “In our life-course theory of crime, we seek to return development to where it probably should have been all along, conceived as the constant interaction between individuals and their environment, coupled with purposeful human agency and random noise.” -> the organism is determined neither by its genes nor by its environment nor by the interaction between them but bears a significant mark of randomness -> make prediction impossible even with perfect measurement. #quote 

**Stability and change**: Found antisocial conduct in childhood contributed to troublesome adult behavior, but they argue this is due to cumulative disadvantage. Similarly they found things like marriage and job stability produced significant changes in adult crime trajectories.

**Age and Crime**: The aggregate age-crime curve is not the same as individual age-crime trajectories. It masks a great deal of heterogeneity. Additionally, crime declines with age even for active offenders. It declines for all groups regardless of variable. “Not only was prediction poor at the individual level, our data raised questions about the sorts of categorically distinct groupings that dominate theoretical and policy discussions.” #quote 

**Desistance**: Marriage, employment, military all knife off the past from the present, provide new structures for supervision and monitoring as well as new opportunities for growth, new structures which change routine activities, new structures which provide opportunities for identity transformation. Using longitudinal difference-in-difference analysis, an individual exhibits lower rates of crime after the event vs. before (selection bias concerns).
