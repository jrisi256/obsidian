## Abstract

Situational theories of crime assert that the situations that people participate in contain the proximal causes of crime. Prior research has not tested situational hypotheses rigorously, either for lack of detailed situational data or for lack of analytical rigor. The present research combines detailed situational data with analytical methods that eliminate all stable between-individual factors as potential confounds. We test seven potential situational causes: 1) presence of peers, 2) absence of adult handlers, 3) public space, 4) unstructured activities, 5) use of alcohol, 6) use of cannabis, and 7) carrying weapons. In a two-wave panel study, a general sample of adolescents completed a space–time budget interview that recorded, hour by hour over the course of 4 complete days, the activities and whereabouts of the subjects, including any self-reported offenses. In total, 76 individuals reported having committed 104 offenses during the 4 days covered in the space–time budget interview. Using data on the 4,949 hours that these 76 offenders spent awake during these 4 days, within-individual, fixed-effects multivariate logit analyses were used to establish situational causes of offending. The findings demonstrate that offending is strongly and positively related to all hypothesized situational causes except using cannabis and carrying weapons.

### Introduction

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2R2GQHLC?page=896&annotation=SYT2UPD9) “The present research combines detailed situational data with analytical methods that eliminate all stable between-individual factors as potential confounds. We test seven potential situational causes: 1) presence of peers, 2) absence of adult handlers, 3) public space, 4) unstructured activities, 5) use of alcohol, 6) use of cannabis, and 7) carrying weapons.” ([Bernasco et al., 2013, p. 896](zotero://select/library/items/4IRZ2EAA))
	* Offending is correlated with all these situations except weed and carrying a weapon.  
  
* Use analytical methods to eliminate all stable between-individual factors. 
	* Within-individual,  [[fixed effects]] multiple variable [[Logistic regression]].

Most of the time they abide by the law without getting involved in any criminal activity. Theories of crime must account for this phenomenon: If crime varies over time, so must at least some of its causes. Therefore, offending must have proximal causes that fluctuate over time much more quickly from hour to hour rather than from year to year—than the more distal causes that are attributed to relatively stable characteristics of individuals and their social environments.” ([Bernasco et al., 2013, p. 896](zotero://select/library/items/4IRZ2EAA))
	* There has to be situational factors which dictate when someone will commit a crime. Since even offenders do not offend the vast majority of the time.

### Methods

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2R2GQHLC?page=911&annotation=P74BZZ83) “Experiments with randomized controls are the gold standard for testing hypotheses on situational causes of crime. The next best alternative uses individuals as their own counterfactuals and compares the situations in which they committed crimes with situations in which they did not. This strategy was the one taken in the present research to rule out measured or unmeasured differences between individuals as potential confounds.” ([Bernasco et al., 2013, p. 911](zotero://select/library/items/4IRZ2EAA))
	* You are basically comparing an individual in a situation where they committed a crime to that same individual later where they did not commit a crime.

	* By using fixed effects, the analyst is able to control for time-invariant (things which are not changing over time) factors between units of analysis.

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2R2GQHLC?page=911&annotation=KWJFGH8X)“Dynamic selection potentially results in an estimated effect of an observed independent variable to be spurious because the observed variable is correlated with an unobserved time-varying variable that contains the true cause of offending. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that other unmeasured variables, for example, the fluctuating emotional state of the individual, are more basic or additional causes of offending.” ([Bernasco et al., 2013, p. 911](zotero://select/library/items/4IRZ2EAA))
	* There may still be time-varying variables leading to [[omitted variable bias]].
	  
* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2R2GQHLC?page=911&annotation=FZXL7NSU)“Because the fixed-effects estimator only uses data from respondents who display variation in the offending variable, all respondents who did not report committing any offense in the space–time budget interview are excluded from the fixed-effects regression analysis.” ([Bernasco et al., 2013, p. 911](zotero://select/library/items/4IRZ2EAA))
	* You need variation in the offending variable.
	  
* Data comes from 76 youth (14-16 years old) who were identified as offenders. Used [[space-time budget interviews]] to help guide the youth through what they did the previous 4 days including if they engaged in any deviant activity (combined violence against persons and violent against property) as well as measuring the key independent variables.

### Results

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2R2GQHLC?page=920&annotation=56RUE4QM) “... presence of peers, absence of adult handlers, presence in public space, involvement in unstructured activity, and alcohol use in situations strongly increases adolescents’ likelihood of offending in those situations. The effects were surprisingly large, suggesting that these situational causes are fundamental in understanding time fluctuations in offending. Between individual differences were ruled out as an alternative explanation by using the space–time budget hours as repeated observations and the adolescents as fixed effects.” ([Bernasco et al., 2013, p. 920](zotero://select/library/items/4IRZ2EAA))
	* Cannabis use and carrying weapons were not associated with an increase in the likelihood of offending.
	  
* The study is powerful because of its granularity and because it can demonstrate, in the moment, these situational factors are associated with delinquency. See [[osgoodRoutineActivitiesIndividual1996]] which found associations between delinquency and the amount of time you spent in unstructured socialization, but they could not statistically test for if delinquency was actually happening during those moments of unstructured socialization.
