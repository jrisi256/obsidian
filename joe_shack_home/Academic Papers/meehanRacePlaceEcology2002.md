## Abstract

We propose an ecological dimension to racial profiling by comparing the distribution of drivers on the roadways with officers' proactive surveillance and stop behavior in a predominantly white suburban community bordering a predominantly African American community. African Americans are subject to significant racial profiling, as reflected in disproportionate surveillance and stopping by the police when driving through whiter areas. Officers' behavior is not explained by African Americans' criminality because the “hit rates” for African American drivers are lower in white areas. Profiling is sensitive to race and place and manifests itself organizationally, reflecting community patterns of residential segregation.

## My notes

See [[sampsonSeeingDisorderNeighborhood2004]] for the differences in perception of disorder.

See also [[kurlychekCumulativeDisadvantageAmerican2019]] for the [[cumulative disadvantage]].

### Research Question

* Black motorists report being stopped more and being subject to more invasive searchers while stopped.
  
* Research suggests disparate treatment may not be the product of race alone but the interaction of individual race and the class composition of a neighborhood influences police perceptions of behavior.
  
* Generally find that Black drivers are subject to disproportionate surveillance and stopping by the police when they drive through white areas. Profiling increases as Black drives move further away from Black communities into wealthier and white areas.
  
* Being a Black driver in a whiter area of a community has more negative consequences than being a Black driver in a blacker area of that same community.
  
* Police officers are preservers of place. They strive to understand what typically occurs in an area and who belongs in an area, and they strive to remove those non-normative elements.
	* This is a problem that [[kellingBrokenWindowsPolice1982]] alluded but just shrug at and do not really adequately address it.

* To what extent do police act solely on the basis of race? Thus they look only at querying behavior that did not result in any further action (i.e., stops). Otherwise, a police officer could legitimately say their resulting action was the result of factors other than race (e.g., suspicious driving behavior).

### Background

Much like [[alexanderNewJimCrow2012]], authors find that Whren vs. the United States was a disaster for allowing officers to make pretextual stops.

Presages [[brayneBigDataSurveillance2017]] in some ways because it talks about the effects of introducing computers into police cars thus allowing police officers the ability to query license plates. "... the state's power to seek out violations, even without specific grounds for suspicion, has been enhanced." #quote 

### Data

* Data comes from a medium-sized (75,000) suburban, predominantly white and blue-collar neighborhood with 100 police officers. Borders a predominantly Black city.
  
* Qualitative observations gave the authors the idea to use police officer queries into their computers as the basis for a quantitative study.
  
	* Have information on the location of the query, time of day, officer's characteristics, and the outcome of the query.
  
* Drivers were coded as White if the place of residence for the owner of the car was from a White neighborhood (>= 97&%) and the same for Black (>= 75%). Drivers not from one of these two types of cities were dropped. Authors argue this is similar to what the police are doing who may often not see the driver's race.
  
	* Using different datasets, they argue this approach works very well.
	  
	* If anything it under-counts Black drivers, thus their estimates are conservative, lower-bound estimates.
	  
* Use 3716 proactive queries (not reactive queries) from a two-week window in April 2000. They remove proactive queries having to do with recorded police stops to focus on pure surveillance activities.
  
* At the same time, they conducted a Roadway Observation Study to assess the racial composition of drivers during the study's time period. Race and gender estimates were generated.

### Main Research Questions

1. Do police officers proactively surveil Black drivers at a rate higher than their actual proportion of drivers on the road?
   
2. Does police officer behavior vary by place?

### Results

13% of drivers were Black whereas 27% of all proactive police queries were about Black drivers.

Place matters -> As Black drivers were further away from the Black parts of the city, the disparity in query rates grew considerably. I.e., police officers have a concept of who belongs where. However, even in those areas which were predominantly Black, Black drivers were still queried at slightly higher rates than Whites given the proportion of Black drivers on the roadway.

Effects replicated for stops.

Plates of Black drivers are more likely to yield a hit than White drivers although the difference in not statistically significant.

* Black drivers have higher hit rates in Blacker areas compared to White drivers in Blacker areas (remember these areas had least amount of disparity).
  
* But White drivers had higher hit rates than Black drivers in Whiter areas! These areas have the highest disparity! "... queries are the highest for Blacks where the hit rate is the lowest." #quote 

When examining results by tercile of police officer usage of the computer (i.e., looking at officers who used the computer a lot, medium amount, and a little) -> authors found that it was the officers who used their computers the most that were the ones with the most racial disparity (both in queries and stops). Furthermore, these disparities persisted when stratified by place.

See [[brayneBigDataSurveillance2017]] -> "We also found that MDT technology may facilitate profiling." -> #question #disagree I would quibble with this interpretation. Is the technology causing the discrepancy? Might not these police officers have been the ones to discriminate anyway? Maybe it is a stretch, but it is worth considering.

#highlight"... it is not helpful to treat racial profiling as an effect of individual officers... Discussions of racial profiling must move beyond a consideration of the intent or motivation of individual officers in individual cases, which dominates legal thinking, to an examination of its embeddedness as a practice within the organizational context of the police and their relationship to the larger societal context from which discrimination, intentional or unintentional emanates... If racial profiling reflects society-wide patterns of segregation and a generalized attitude about who belongs where, focusing on police 'attitudes' or 'cultural sensitivity' will not solve the problem."

"... focus on individual attitudes and behavior misses the underlying societal and occupational structural problems that produce racial profiling... We propose that even the most racially sensitive officers engaged in racial profiling." #paper_idea 

#highlight Efforts to regulate officer discretion may not work e.g., making them record all stops. Discussion on the flexibility of rules and the difficultly which comes in taming discretion. Additionally, a log of an officer's stops would be performative conforming to bureaucratic expectations. Logs are created for the purposes of the policing organization.
