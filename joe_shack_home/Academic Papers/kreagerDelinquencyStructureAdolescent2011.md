## Abstract

Gangs and group-level processes were once central phenomena for criminological theory and research. By the mid-1970s, however, gang research primarily was displaced by studies of individual behavior using randomized self-report surveys, a shift that also removed groups from the theoretical foreground. In this project, we return to the group level to test competing theoretical claims about delinquent group structure. We use network-based clustering methods to identify 897 friendship groups in two ninth-grade cohorts of 27 Pennsylvania and Iowa schools. We then relate group-level measures of delinquency and drinking to network measures of group size, friendship reciprocity, transitivity, structural cohesion, stability, average popularity, and network centrality. We find significant negative correlations between group delinquency and all of our network measures, suggesting that delinquent groups are less solidary and less central to school networks than nondelinquent groups. Additional analyses, on the one hand, reveal that these correlations are explained primarily by other group characteristics, such as gender composition and socioeconomic status. Drinking behaviors, on the other hand, show net positive associations with most of the network measures, suggesting that drinking groups have a higher status and are more internally cohesive than nondrinking groups. Our findings shed light on a long-standing criminological debate by suggesting that any structural differences between delinquent and nondelinquent groups are likely attributable to other characteristics coincidental with delinquency. In contrast, drinking groups seem to provide peer contexts of greater social capital and cohesion.

## My notes

### What is the research question?

* What is the relationship between delinquency and group cohesion and group structure? Does it have a negative, positive, or no relationship?

### Why is it important?

* The majority of present-day criminology research uses individual surveys with random samples of youth. This represents a methodological loss because researchers are less able to understand the effects of groups on delinquency.
	* Of course, they have their place. It allows for the generalizability of theory across race and social strata.
	  
* Previous research has found that delinquent friendships are no different from conforming friendships in regards to their levels of trust, closeness, and stability. In contrast with [[Social control theory|social control]]. Previous research has found, though, that delinquent friendships could be more conflicted and argumentative. However, this research is limited by its data source (random, individual-level surveys), or if they were able to survey a group they did not focus on group-level measures (or they have been limited to only those friends who are listed as friends and not other individuals).
  
*  Most previous studies have combined too many offenses into the final dependent variable, deviance. Theft and violence (not typical of adolescence) should really be separated out from things like drinking and public disturbance (more typical of adolescents).

### How do you propose to answer the question?

* **Measuring groups**: They will use a quantitative, structural approach which is focused on maximizing the proportion of ties within a group vs. ties between groups (in contrast to self-defined groups).
	* How tightly connected or cohesive are the groups?
		* **Reciprocity**, **Transitivity**, **Structural cohesion** (the number of independent paths which hold members in a group together), **Group stability** (how frequently membership in a group shifts over time).
	* **Average popularity** (how many friendship nominations individual group members receive relative to other students), **Group centrality** (the number of friendship nominations a group receives from other groups compared to the number of friendship nominations it sends to other groups).
	* [[social network analysis]]. #social_network_analysis 
	  
* Data comes from the [[PROSPER]] dataset (Promoting School-Community-University Partnerships to Enhance Resilience).
  
* **Independent variables**: Group-level measures of delinquency and drinking. It is based upon individual group members' self-reports of delinquent behavior. Uses [[item response theory]] to score the delinquency measures.
  
* **Controls**: They control for demographics, poverty, family attachment, school engagement, and religious engagement.
  
* They use [[Multilevel modeling|multilevel modeling]] where individuals are level 1 and groups are level 2.

### What do you find?

1. Highly delinquent groups are smaller, less connected, more tenuous, and have lower status.
2. High drinking groups have higher group cohesion, higher popularity, and higher centrality -> party behaviors are associated with increased social capital.
   
1. Including the control variables leads to an attenuation of the effect size for the main independent variables and a loss of statistical significance for many of them. 
	1. Including school engagement and religious engagement fully attenuates the effects of delinquency on many of the outcome variables.
		1. The tendency for delinquent groups to have a weaker internal structure is fully explained by the attributes of the group rather than the delinquency itself.
	2. However, the group drinking coefficients increase in size and in most cases achieve statistical significance when the attachment variables are included.
2. Less delinquent drinking groups tend to be composed of high SES and predominantly female members.
3. Non-drinking delinquent groups tend to be low SES and predominantly male.
4. Groups with members who are strongly connected to school, family, and church are more likely to be internally cohesive and stable.

* Authors argue that in line with social control theory that delinquent groups are less cohesive, but in strong contrast to social control theory, it is not because of the delinquency but due to the compositional factors of the group. #theory_challenge 
* The drinking findings also go against a lot of criminological findings suggesting that all deviant behaviors (or even drinking and substance usage) should be concentrated among low SES individuals. #theory_challenge In fact, they are even more popular than would be expected when accounting for their weaker graders and school attachment.
