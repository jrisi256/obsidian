## Abstract

We extend the routine activity perspective's situational analysis of crime to individual offending and to a broad range of deviant behaviors. In this view, unstructured socializing with peers in the absence of authority figures presents opportunities for deviance: In the presence of peers, deviant acts will be easier and more rewarding; the absence of authority figures reduces the potential for social control responses to deviance; and the lack of structure leaves time available for deviant behavior. To determine whether individuals who spend more time in unstructured socializing activities engage in deviant behaviors more frequently, we analyzed within-individual changes in routine activities and deviance across five waves of data for a national sample of more than 1,700 18- to 26-year-olds. Participation in these routine activities was strongly associated with criminal behavior, heavy alcohol use, use of marijuana and other illicit drugs, and dangerous driving. Furthermore, routine activities accounted for a substantial portion of the association between these deviant behaviors and age, sex, and socioeconomic status.

## My notes

### Main question

* Time spent in informal, unsupervised socializing with peers carries no direct implications for deviance. However, adolescent antisocial behavior is more likely to the degree adolescents spend less time in the company of adults and more time in the company of their peers in an unstructured and unsupervised way

* This is connected to [[Routine activity]] theory because it is arguing that crime is intimately connected to opportunity and not the persons. Same for guardians (not appealing to social bonds) -> opportunities for guardianship arise out of the situation.
	* Juveniles wishing to deviate do so because the situation presents itself -> not because of the person or because of commitment to non-conventional values.
	* The old issue of [[selection bias]] -> Are individuals more willing to commit crime selecting into situations where they hang out a lot with their peers in an unstructured way?
	* Authors argue people may vary in their susceptibility to crime, but everyone is susceptible given the right opportunity -> there is not some special group who are uniquely different from all other juveniles.
	  
* Extend the theory -> Motivated offenders can derive motivation from the situation. Susceptible targets are situations where deviant acts are seen as possible and rewarding.
  
* Why peers? Engaging in dangerous activities is a way of bonding and boosting reputation.
  
* Why unstructured time? Less guardians and less opportunities to deviate (although they do not argue that participating in structured activities reduces deviance as involvement from [[Social control theory|social control]] theory has not panned empirically). 

### How do you propose to answer it?

* Longitudinal data which can control for individual-level, time-stable differences. [[fixed effects]]. Like self-control, shots fired at self-control theory #theory_challenge . However, changes in the individual, such as in their social bonds or in their [[differential association]] could be at play.
	* [[Random effects]] -> more efficient in the sense that it has better opportunity to detect effects or higher power. The efficiency comes at the cost of assuming a normal distribution of the time invariant individual differences. Check out the Petersen paper they cite. #highlight
* Sample of 18 to 26 year olds. [[Monitoring the Future study]].
* **Independent variables**
	* Routine activities -> How much time you spend in some unstructured activities? Like riding around in the car, spending nights out, etc.
	* Control for age, sex, parents' socioeconomic status, high school grades.
* **Dependent variables**
	* Deviant behaviors -> criminal behavior, heavy alcohol use, marijuana use, etc.
* One of the few papers I have seen that actually uses [[Bonferroni correction]] -> very impressive.

### What do you find?

* Table 1 -> Unstructured socializing (particularly riding for fun and going to parties) is associated with all forms of delinquent behavior.
* Table 2 -> Routine activities can help us make sense of differences in deviancy by age, sex, school performance, and socioeconomic status.
	* E.g., men engage in unstructured socializing more than women.
	* Except for riding around for fun, all other unstructured activities are associated with higher socioeconomic status -> having parents with more education was associated with more unstructured time which is associated with higher deviant behavior.
* Table 3 -> Controlling for the rate of unstructured socialization can help uncover interesting trends and shrink the gaps in deviancy. E.g. in their sample, after controlling for unstructured socialization, women used drugs other than marijuana more than men.
	* Argues against social control theory #theory_challenge that lower rates of deviancy among people who succeed at school does not simply reflect commitment to conventional avenues of success. Students who succeed in school spend less time in situations which are ripe for deviancy.
* Young men who were doing poorly in school and who had parents with high educational credentials had the most unstructured free time and who committed the most deviancy vs. older women who were doing well at school and who had less educational credentials who had the least amount of unstructured free time and thus the least amount deviancy -> only broad trends.
