## Abstract

The [[labeling theory]] of deviance was extremely popular during the 1960s and 1970s. After a series of influential critiques, however, the validity of the theory had fallen into question by 1980 and was pronounced dead by 1985. In this paper we examine the application of the labeling perspective to one particular area, juvenile delinquency. We discuss the general theoretical origin of labeling theory in both [[conflict theory]] and [[symbolic interactionism]], and use it to present two main labeling hypotheses: 1) that status attributes are influential in determining who is labeled (the “status characteristics hypothesis”) and 2) that labeling experiences are instrumental in producing problems of adjustment and in causing subsequent commitment to further deviance (the “secondary deviance hypothesis”). We note that what is often passed off as a critique of labeling theory itself is frequently a caricature of the theory. The major point of the paper is an elaboration of the full complexity of each labeling hypothesis, a suggestion for empirical research to test it, and a review of the extant literature. We suggest that labeling theory is not as invalid as its critics have claimed, and that what is needed is a restatement and revitalization of a labeling theory of delinquency.

## My notes

### Theoretical Origins of Labeling Theory

- Conflict Theory -> Deviance is a power struggle between contending parties. Stated by Lofland, “Deviance is the name of the conflict game in which individuals or loosely organized small groups with little power are strongly feared by a well-organized, sizable minority or majority who have a large amount of power.” Also differential rule enforcement. #quote 

- Several levels of analysis -> 
	1) collective rule making (those with power make the rules).
	2) organizational processing (social control organizational level).
	3) interpersonal relations (bargaining over labels in day-to-day encounters e.g. between the sighted and the blind).

- Symbolic interactionism -> Examining the consequences of rule enforcement for those whom labels are directed. Efforts at social control may be counterproductive as they lead to stigmatization and isolation of those labeled as deviant leading to [[Secondary Deviance]]. It isn’t deterministic. Describes conditions under which subsequent deviance may result.

### Main areas of research

- The role of economic/political power in creating delinquency.
- The influence of extralegal attributes in determining who is labeled as deviant by social control organizations.
- The contribution of social/physical attributes in determining face-to-face encounters.
- The experience of being labeled by social control agencies may result in an alteration of personal identity, exclusion from normal routines, and greater involvement in deviant acts.

### Tittle critique

* Tittle interpreted labeling theory to mean that social characteristics should be the *most important variable* in determining labeling outcomes (more important than actual rule breaking). To falsify labeling theory, one would demonstrate that status characteristics are less important than the seriousness of the offense in determining who gets labeled.
	* To argue status characteristics have *some effect* would mean that labeling theory is not contributing anything new to criminological theory, and if it does not specify a precise effect, it is doubly not adding anything new.
* Why was labeling theory held to this arbitrary standard? [[Social control theory|Social control]] has often demonstrated that its variables are influential, but they are rarely the *most* important.
* Additionally, so long as the variables demonstrate statistical significance in the face of relevant controls, the theory will have proven itself important enough (regardless of if the theory states precise enough effect sizes).
* While it may be true that sociologists have known for a long time that justice is not totally blind and the characteristics of the offender matter as the type of justice received, authors argue sociologists, prior to labeling theory, failed to seriously incorporate this fact into their theories. More precisely, "... they did not examine directly the role of the state or state agencies in the construction of norms or the creation of delinquent careers." (page 367 or page 10 of the PDF). #quote 
	* Again, aren't other theories subject to this same criticism? Doesn't everyone know you learn crime by hanging out with criminal others picking up bad habits and attitudes?
  
### Areas of future research within the Conflict tradition

- Consider the vertical direction of the law namely 1) the law is directed against those of lower social position, 2) law violations by those of lower status against those of higher status are most likely to elicit a response from agents of social control. I.e. we need to be considering not only the characteristics of the offender but also of the victim.

- Cumulative effects of status variables over the entire sequence of juvenile justice case processing rather than just at single decision points. Race/social class related to type of legal representation. Sampson has found an ecological bias where juvenile’s are more likely to be arrested given a lower social status of their neighborhood.

### Symbolic Interactionist Tradition

- Deviant label is assumed to reflect one’s essential self. Others assume your intent, ascribe deviant motives to your actions. Stigmatization and segregation then set in. Three consequences (None are inevitable of course, and neither will it be solely determined by those who impute the label):
	1) Alteration of identity.
	2) Exclusion from conventional opportunities.
	3) Increase in the probability of further deviance.

- The social audience may sometimes (inclusive reaction) keep the person within their group in an attempt to counteract the label.

- Some people labeled as deviant refuse the label. Can sometimes be successful.

- Contingent nature of the labeling process as it depends on -> how public is the label, reactions of others, how altered is your identity, support from deviant others.

- Others come to court the deviant identity seeing some benefits to be gained from it (potentially greater than trying to fight it or simply accepting it cannot be fought).

- Thus secondary deviance rests heavily on the subjective interpretation (which depends on exterior variables) of the label. Actors assign their own meaning of the deviant label based on their own understanding and history thus making the label subjectively meaningful.

- Self-fulfilling prophecy stuff can set in with things like stigmatization. Believe what others say about you.
