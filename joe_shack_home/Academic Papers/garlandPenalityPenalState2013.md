## Abstract

The sociology of punishment has developed a rich understanding of the social and historical forces that have transformed American penality during the last 40 years. But whereas these social forces are not unique to the United States, their penal impact there has been disproportionately large, relative to comparable nations. To address this issue, I suggest that future research should attend more closely to the structure and operation of the penal state. I begin by distinguishing penality (the penal field) from the penal state (the governing institutions that direct and control the penal field). I then present a preliminary conceptualization of “the penal state” and discuss the relationship between the penal state and the American state more generally.

## Highlighted Notes

### Introduction

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=475&annotation=5ZTLS46M) To Garland's point (on crime and its relation to criminal justice policy and how they *do* affect each other), criminal justice reform efforts have gained traction during this time period of low crime. Restorative justice, decarceration are old ideas. But they have only gained traction in times of low crime.
  
* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=475&annotation=ZQINIQC5) Unrelated *USA* is an individualistic nation. Crime is an individual problem of *bad*, *misguided*, *immoral* people. So we need to *fix* them or *punish* them or.

### USA Exceptionalism

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=477&annotation=GG3XI7GY) “First, there is the persistence of capital punishment in the United States at a time when all the other liberal democracies in the Western world have abandoned its use.”
  
* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=477&annotation=89YN9KQD) “Second, during the last 40 years, America has developed a rate of imprisonment that is greatly in excess of prior American rates, much higher than that of comparable nations, and probably the highest of any nation in world history.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 477](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
  
* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=477&annotation=UQWENTD7) “A third feature is the racial cast of America’s prisons and jails—a phenomenon that echoes the racial disparities long affecting the administration of capital punishment.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 477](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
  
* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=478&annotation=MUKY35PI) “Fourth, America’s extensive use of incarceration is paralleled by its use of probation and parole:” ([Garland, 2013, p. 478](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
  
* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=478&annotation=K25FF36D) “The final feature of American penality I would mention has to do with the disqualifications and disabilities that follow on a felony conviction.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 478](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))

### Research Question

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=479&annotation=VPX5ISXE)“America’s distinctive combination of liberal democracy and penal intensity seems anomalous and poses an explanatory problem of some importance.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 479](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
  
* Different previous studies have focused on different aspects of the USA's exceptionalism in the case of mass incarceration. Each of these different studies, this author argues, are differences in emphasis and in kind, rather than true differences. I think I would tend to agree.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=481&annotation=Q9CPYZMG) “But, considered from the point of view of the field as a whole, their competing claims seem complementary rather than mutually exclusive... ”
	  
* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=482&annotation=SA3WGM8Q) “... many of the social forces identified as causes of American penal change also have been operative in other nations but without producing the scale and intensity of penal expansion that occurred in the United States.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 482](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
  
* This author argues we should be focused on analyzing and understanding the distinctive state and governmental structures (which are very unique to the USA) to understand why we're so distinct in regards to our criminal justice system. We should not look at broader social causes.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=483&annotation=E2EZ9HJG) “Consequently, instead of concentrating primarily on social causes, as the literature has done up until now, we should focus on state structures and processes and seek to analyze the American state in comparative perspective.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 483](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
	  
* Capital punishment persists because of the distinct nature of the American state and the radically, popular majoritarian control of the power to punish. Similar arguments exist for the other distinctive features of the criminal justice system. We should be accounting for this and not get bogged down in our sociological biases.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=484&annotation=KNRZ5LPI) “... distinctive character of the American state and the radically local, popular majoritarian control of the power to punish. What I am now proposing is a similarly state-centered, comparative inquiry into the distinctive characteristics of American penality more generally.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 484](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=484&annotation=EXBIIJXS) “In accounting for expanded prison populations and increased rates of imprisonment, the most immediate causes are specific forms of state action:” ([Garland, 2013, p. 484](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=484&annotation=QJC85N68) “The precise nature of these legal enactments is crucial because small variations in enacted laws or their enforcement may produce large variations in penal outcomes.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 484](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
	  
* One example would be California -> look to its structures in how legislation and enforcement decisions are made.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=485&annotation=EXZ9HU9Q) “Explaining why California’s prison population is larger than that of other states is, thus, in the first instance, a matter of accounting for legislative and enforcement differences, rather than of identifying the social factors that push for mandatory penalties and severe sentencing.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 485](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
	  
* What is the relationship between crime rates and punishment? Well it is complicated. It's the perception of crime and how it's problematized which gives rise to the types of punishments we see. This author argues it is an oversimplification that perceptions of crime lead to changes in penal policy in a linear fashion. But, they do have a relation to one another. I see his point, but I think I'm more likely to believe the other side of the issue here. Rather, I think they're both basically saying the same thing.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=486&annotation=DLMBDEQ9) “(The sociological insight here is that neither individual crimes nor aggregate crime rates determine the nature or extent of penal measures. It is not 'crime' that dictates penal laws, penal sentences, and penal policies but the ways in which crime is socially perceived and problematized and the political and administrative decisions to which these perceptions give rise.)” ([Garland, 2013, p. 486](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=487&annotation=32MQTFPT) “Penal processes develop in a complex relation to crime processes, and one does not directly or immediately determine the other.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 487](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4)) 

### Framing

* When we talk about crime rates, what are we actually talking about? Simply using one measure as *the measure* is misleading. See below example for welfare policy. We need to consider the broader context. It can be tricky to think about the appropriate context in which to consider a problem -> depends on one's goals and time period of examination.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=487&annotation=L7943XWY) “Whenever we evaluate a social policy—whether a penal policy or some other kind—that policy should be located within the problem environment in which it operates.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 487](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=488&annotation=CWBA5S68)“ The third of these frames—penal policy as a mode of governing the poor—has been shown to be an appropriate description in certain contexts (Garland, 1985; Wacquant, 2009b). The second frame, where imprisonment is a policy response to perceived crime control problems, is generally applicable, whatever the relevance of broader considerations of social control.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 488](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=489&annotation=98HI8GBA) “That a nation imposes high rates of incarceration relative to other nations certainly tells us something about that nation. But what exactly does it tell us? That it processes more offenders? That more of its offenders are guilty of serious crimes? That it sends offenders to custody when other nations use noncustodial penalties?” ([Garland, 2013, p. 489](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
	  
* This author claims we should also be doing small-n studies where we do deep dives on a few settings. These large-n studies are, of course useful. But they're difficulties in reducing a nation down to a few dozen variables and comparing them across other nations and calling them similar. It masks too much variation.
* Focus too much on quantifiable variables and not enough on processes.
* Lack of a theory perhaps? Point to recurring patterns and associations. But not why they occur.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=490&annotation=M3TL2E5C) “These large comparative studies provide important information, allowing broad causal claims to be tested and supplying empirical parameters for more detailed inquiry. But for all their utility in these respects, such studies also have definite limits and should be viewed as one comparative tool” ([Garland, 2013, p. 490](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=491&annotation=F62QVGUK) “... study processes, event sequences, and the choice-point contingencies that shape institutional outcomes.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 491](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=491&annotation=ZR7553KM) “... no coherent model... ” ([Garland, 2013, p. 491](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
	* Example deep dive. Interesting analysis of how different the English and Welsh systems are and how they could produce different results in the face of increasing crime (needed to do a deep dive). -> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=492&annotation=NCWGNQZR) “... the two criminal justice systems differed markedly in the extent to which they were 'systems' capable of being managed.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 492](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4)) 

### Penal state

* Definition:
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=495&annotation=I44AY2MW) “In my use, the term 'penal state' is not a critical term: It is used in a neutral, non-evaluative sense to describe the agencies and authorities who make binding penal rules and direct their implementation.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 495](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4)) #definition 
	  
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=495&annotation=XYIRUSC8) “Nor is my use of the concept intended to refer to the whole penal system and its apparatus of prisons, jails, correctional staff, and so on. The 'penal state' refers instead to the leadership elites that direct and control the use of that apparatus and its personnel. Here I am distinguishing between the exercise of penal power and the apparatus through which that power is exercised. 'Penal state' refers to the penal leadership and its authority, not to the penal infrastructure that this leadership directs.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 495](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
	  
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=496&annotation=C3PDRH7A) “... the state legislature, executive and judiciary acting in their penal capacity (enacting penal laws, authorizing penal budgets, or adjudicating penal issues), together with the leadership of penal agencies who shape penal policy and direct its day-to-day implementation (police commissioners, chief prosecutors, judicial elites, justice department chiefs, correctional commissioners, prison wardens, probation service directors, state parole board members, etc.).” ([Garland, 2013, p. 496](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))

### Variables of power

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=496&annotation=Q4EGGB8I)“The most important dimensions for our purposes are as follows: 1) state autonomy, 2) internal autonomy, 3) control of the power to punish, 4) modes of penal power, and 5) power resources and capacities.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 496](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))

1. How autonomous is state power to direct punishment? How insulated are they from popular opinion?
	1. [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=497&annotation=WHR2DWAV) “Is state penal policy determined from the outside by interest group demands, public opinion polls, media headlines, and voter ballot initiatives? Or is it shaped by state officials acting in accordance with their own interests and ideologies? Between these two possibilities lies the variable of state autonomy.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 497](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
	   
2. Do penal elites and experts draft their own laws? Or is it imposed on them by legislatures and/or the majority?
	1. [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=498&annotation=LVZ9JFHL) “It is a measure of the extent to which penal state activities and interventions are controlled and directed from within, i.e., by the penal state’s own leadership.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 498](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
	   
3. What is the source of their power and autonomy? How strong is it?
	1. [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=498&annotation=8P4CJF7M) “Are the leaders of penal state agencies political appointees who serve at the pleasure of an elected official? Are they, themselves, elected officials or are they tenured career civil servants?” ([Garland, 2013, p. 498](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
	   
4. Where is the power to punish located?
	1. [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=500&annotation=7RL38R22) “It matters where control of the power to punish is located, and it matters who controls its deployment. Control may be retained by the legislature. It may be possessed by powerful prosecutors. It may be exercised by judges or juries. It may be delegated to penal administrators. It may be shared with commercial entities or private-sector partnerships. It may be reviewed by appellate judges or even taken over by court-appointed monitors.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 500](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
	   
5. What modes does the power of the penal state take? Kill? Incarcerate? Supervise? Fine?
	1. [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=500&annotation=8S9H9LQ9) “Penal power takes different forms and may be oriented toward different ends. The power to kill, the power to incarcerate, the power to supervise, the power to levy fines, the power to transform individual conduct, and the power to transform families or communities are distinct forms,” ([Garland, 2013, p. 500](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))

6. What technology is used and is available to the penal state? [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=501&annotation=34EIXVD2)
   
7. What is the penal state's actual capacity and available resources for punishing? [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=501&annotation=LYEYYXK4)
   
8. All nations faced the same/similar broader trends of neoliberalism, consumer capitalism, immigration, ethnic tensions, etc. The penal response provoked depends upon the penal state (categorized by the relevant variables outlined above).
	1. [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=502&annotation=FEG2X22R) “But the penal 'response' that they provoke varies and varies in patterned, nonrandom ways. My working hypothesis would be that this patterning is explained by differences between penal states. A conceptual model of the penal state may therefore provide a theoretical basis for comparative and historical research.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 502](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))

### So why the USA?

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=504&annotation=RQ34W5VF)“ America’s penal power is chiefly directed to producing stigmatized, excluded individuals and, because it is so massive in its reach, to producing stigmatized, excluded groups and disorganized communities. It does not, for the most part, produce outcomes such as social stability or integration, or even law-abiding citizenship.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 504](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))

* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=505&annotation=7E4X62EA)“In fact, it seems more plausible to suggest that the extensive use of carceral power is a compensatory mechanism, providing a back-up penal control where more positive and more productive modes of social control are unavailable.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 505](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
  
* Weak/strong dichotomy is bad and too limiting. Our penal state is a sign of our weaknesses since why would a state choose such a destructive and counter-productive route, willingly.
* We are *weak* central state when it comes to criminal justice. We cannot simply erect change at the local level (from the federal level). We have to engage in politics.
* Our liberalism is at war with our commitment to democracy.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=505&annotation=R67CUSSQ) “If that is the case, then the extensive use of negative penal power may be an indication of deficiencies in the American state’s governmental capacities—particularly its capacity for more positive, social modes of governing—rather than of newfound strengths.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 505](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=506&annotation=WYZHV4E4) “America is a liberal democracy, but “liberalism” and “democracy” are different traditions, involving different political principles and practices, each of which has distinct implications for the power to punish.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 506](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=507&annotation=NKGLKZLW)“To the extent that popular majorities are empowered, there is nothing incompatible between full democracy and full on punishment.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 507](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=507&annotation=GBHJRSE7) “Liberal institutions tend to constrain state punishment in the name of limited government and the rights of individuals. Democratic institutions punish in accordance with majority preferences, whatever these may be. What we call “liberal democracy” is a merger of (specific kinds of) liberal institutions and (specific kinds of) democratic institutions, and each nation, each polity, exhibits a different mixture.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 507](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
	  
* So why did mass incarceration happen here? Mass incarceration is not fully the result of a punitive culture, especially hostile racial divisions, or even especially high rates of crime and violence.
* We give too much power to local majorities.
* Our liberal, counter-majority institutions haven't been able (or willing?) to stand up to the democratic wave.
* The same factors which inhibit the growth of a strong social safety net in the USA are the same which promote the growth of a punitive penal state.
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=507&annotation=ZZR85G94)“The explanation, it seems to me, lies in America’s distinctive instantiation of liberal democracy and in the distinctive institutions that characterize the American state.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 507](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=507&annotation=PZC6AACU) “America’s radically local, popular majoritarian democracy allocates primary control over criminal law and criminal justice to local (state and county) rather than to national (federal) political processes.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 507](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=508&annotation=9FGFPZDH)“Contemporary American penality is in large part testimony to the recurring reluctance of America’s liberal institutions, above all the courts, to temper the mood of 'the people' and their political representatives when it comes to punishing offenders and “protecting the public.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 508](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
	* [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E74JZGLK?page=509&annotation=YHNF8G9F) “In regard to punishment, the effects of the same American state structures are just the opposite.” ([Garland, 2013, p. 509](zotero://select/library/items/BK7RSCW4))
