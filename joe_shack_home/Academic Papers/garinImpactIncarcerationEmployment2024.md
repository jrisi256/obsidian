## Abstract

We study the effect of incarceration on wages, self-employment, and taxes and transfers in North Carolina and Ohio using two quasi-experimental research designs: discontinuities in sentencing guidelines and random assignment to judges. Across both states, incarceration generates shortterm drops in economic activity while individuals remain in prison. As a result, a year-long sentence decreases cumulative earnings over five years by 13%. Beyond five years, however, there is no evidence of lower employment, wage earnings, or self-employment in either state, as well as among defendants with no prior incarceration history. These results suggest that upstream factors, such as other types of criminal justice interactions or pre-existing labor market detachment, are more likely to be the cause of low earnings among the previously incarcerated, who we estimate would earn just $5,000 per year on average if spared a prison sentence.

| Modeling Strategy     | 1) Ohio: [[two stage least-squares regression]] -> First estimate the incarceration sentence as a function of the judge, controls, and court-month fixed effects. Second, estimate the outcome as a function of the incarceration sentence, controls, and court-month fixed effects.<br><br>2) North Carolina: [[two stage least-squares regression]] -> First estimate incarceration length as  function of criminal history, current charge, and grid cell boundaries. Then estimate an outcome including incarceration length and controls (pre-incarceration wages and employment, age, sex, and race, criminal history).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Results               | In both Ohio and North Carolina, the effect of a 12-month sentence decreases likelihood of employment up to 2 years after filing and decreases wages up to 3 years after filing. After these periods of time, the effects of incarceration become null.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Interpretation        | 1) Incarceration has limited lasting impacts on employment outcomes and most negative outcomes are likely due to being incapacitated. However, this does this mean there are very real lasting long-term cumulative losses.<br><br>2) "... most defendants are only weakly attached to the labor market prior to their case regardless of the sentence..." i.e., absent incarceration these individuals would likely continue to experience limited employment opportunities. More upstream factors (perhaps other CJ interactions), lack of human capital development, and broader environmental + social influences are likely responsible for poor labor outcomes.<br><br>3) "Though there are other reasons to reduce incarceration rates... doing so may not automatically improve labor market outcomes... Incarceration itself may be more of a symptom of the same forces causing low labor market attachment..."<br><br>4) Reaction to differences in other studies in particular audit studies -> "These studies typically measure the impact of disclosing any criminal history... may overstate how employers would react to variation in incarceration history among applicants with at least some criminal history record, a comparison closer to what is captured by out experiment. The fictional job applicant used in these studies are also somewhat atypical." |
| Additional Analyses   | 1) Examine differences in outcomes for individuals who did and did not have a prior record of incarceration at the time of their case to explore the effects of ever being incarcerated. Results largely the same.<br><br>2) Individuals who were previously more involved in the labor market experienced steeper declines in employment prospects and earnings and take slightly longer to recover.<br><br>3) No differential effects by race.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
I do not exactly understand how they are constructing the counterfactual groups since they mention people in the *control* often receive the treatment (i.e., incarceration) as well (just later on). Is it people within a given month who received one judge vs. another? And then people in a given month who received a sentence just above vs. just below the cutoff?

It's confusing because that does that mean individuals who are later incarcerated (but were originally not) then become part of the second-wave of treatment?

Also would effects be more severe for longer sentences?
