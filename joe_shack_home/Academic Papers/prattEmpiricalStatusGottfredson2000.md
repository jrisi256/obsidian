## Abstract

To determine the empirical status of Gottfredson and Hirschi's (1990) “general theory of crime,” we conducted a meta-analysis on existing empirical studies. The results indicate that, regardless of measurement differences, low self-control is an important predictor of crime and of “analogous behaviors.” Also, low self-control has general effects across different types of samples. Contrary to Gottfredson and Hirschi's position, however, the effect of low self-control is weaker in longitudinal studies, and variables from social learning theory still receive support in studies that include a measure of low self-control. Finally, we argue that meta-analysis is an underutilized tool in discerning the relative empirical merits of criminological theories.

## My notes

### Key findings

* Low self-control is an important predictor of crime and analogous behaviors.
* Contrary to the position of [[gottfredsonGeneralTheoryCrime1990]], they find that low self-control has weaker effects in longitudinal studies. Furthermore, variables from [[differential association]] still receive support in models with include measures of self-control.

### Recap of [[Social control theory|social control]] and self-control

* Crime provides easy accomplished and immediate gratification. Other behaviors seen as deviant (e.g., smoking, unprotected sex, driving recklessly) are analogous to crime. People who commit crime tend to commit these analogous behaviors.
  
* Because these actions are gratifying, the key is understanding why people do not commit these crimes (not why do they commit these crimes).
  
* People committing crimes and other analogous behaviors start manifesting conduct problems early in life. Getting in trouble reflects a stable pattern of behavior. This calls into question theories which link crime to social processes which do not occur until after childhood (even Hirschi's own social bonding theory).
	* Commitment to education, status frustration in the job market, being enmeshed in a gang cannot explain why children enter onto a pathway to crime long before being exposed to these social conditions.
	* The relationship of these variables to crime is spurious. They are manifestations of the same prime causal variable.
	  
* What separates criminal from non-criminals across the life course? Low self-control. Offenders are impulsive, insensitive, physical, risk-taking, short sighted, and non-verbal.
	* Measure self-control and crime separately to avoid tautology.
	* Low self-control will only result in a crime when the opportunity presents itself.
	* Implicit in all of these assumptions is that crime is easy.
	  
* The origins of self-control come from childhood. Weak direct control exerted by parents results in weak self-control among their offspring.
  
* Cross-sectional analyses should suffice. Individual differences in self-control remain stable over the life-course. Self-control should be measured not through attitudinal scales but through participation in analogous behaviors (major tautology alert).
	* Critics argue you are just finding a *generality of deviance* correlation.
	  
* Although they argue other criminological theories are spurious, they argue especially that differential association is spurious. Individuals with low self-control will end up in each other's company and self-select to be each other (no learning going on).

### Prior findings

* Some studies have challenged how effective self-control is in predicting white collar crime and how stable self-control really is through the [[Life course theory|life-course]].
* The ability for self-control variables to cause other variables to lose their explanatory power does not hold.
* Nevertheless, there is fairly consistent evidence that low self-control is correlated with a higher likelihood of committing crime measured in a variety of ways. Furthermore, it is related to more general negative life outcomes like poor social bonds, lifestyles, and low socioeconomic status. Self-control also tends to remain significant even when controlling for other variables.
	* Self-control has been operationalized in a variety of ways with various controls in cross-sectional and longitudinal designs using a variety of different sampling frames with a variety of different dependent variables.
* Most reviews, though, have been [[narrative reviews]].
* This article proposes using a [[meta-analysis]].

### Goals

* Assess the effect size of self-control.
* Assess how influential opportunity is (interaction between self-control and opportunity)?
* Is the effect size of self-control moderated by study design? (e.g., how it is operationalized, model specification, different research designs, and sample characteristics).
* Will variables from differential association remain significant in the presence of self-control variables?

### Issues

* To mitigate against [[publication bias]], they estimate how many studies with a null finding would need have to be published (or kept in the file drawer) to drive the effect size down to 0.
* To control for method strength, they systematically code each study on a variety of dimensions (not necessarily as a weak or strong study but as a weaker or stronger study e.g., cross-sectional vs. longitudinal).
* If you still think the meta-analysis is wrong because the quality of prior research is bad, you now have the opportunity to conduct your own research with a guide on what not to do.

### Measurements

* **Self-control measure**: Was the measure attitudinal or behavioral?
* **Model specification/research design**: Was an opportunity measure included? Was an interaction term included? What other control variables from which theories were included? Was the study cross-sectional or longitudinal?
* **Sample characteristics**: Community or offender sample? Male vs. female sample? Adult vs. juvenile sample? Racially heterogeneous or homogeneous (only White Americans)?
* **Dependent variable**: Predict crime? Or an analogous behavior?
* **Did the study include variables from social learning theory? And if so, were those variables significant and they did significantly increase the amount of variation the model could explain?**

### Results

* Self-control is a strong predictor of crime using attitudinal or behavioral measures (although the behavioral measures are more logically and statistically brittle). Its effect size is one of the strongest known correlates of crime.
* Opportunity plays an important role in shaping how self-control manifests itself in deviant behavior (as measured by interaction effects). However, self-control is still important even when opportunity is controlled for.
* Self-control is still important even when controlling for variables from other theories.
* **Self-control variables are not statistically significant predictors in the longitudinal setting**.
* Self-control is consistent across all the sampling frames. However, the effect size does vary considerably.
* Self-control is consistent across all types of dependent variables.
* **Differential association, social learning, and delinquent definition variables remain important even when controlling for self-control**.

### Discussion

* Lots of non-scientific reasons exist as to why scientific theories become popular or dominant. We hope, though, that the scientific reasons dominate, and the empirical data should guide the discussion.
	* However, there is a big problem in criminology which is that few theories are presented as a set of formal, logically interrelated propositions that can be falsified. Criminological theories are presented discursively over tens if not hundreds of pages over many years across many works. Leads to issues of if the theory was properly understood and has been adequately tested.
* Meta-analyses can help organize knowledge around which criminological theories enjoy the most support, and they can help clarify the diversity with which theories have been operationalized (and which operationalizations enjoy the most support which may not accord with what the theory originally intended...).
* Also important to note that meta-analyses cannot adjudicate logical assessments of a theory. E.g., is self-control a new concept? Is it just a repackaging of ideas from psychology?
