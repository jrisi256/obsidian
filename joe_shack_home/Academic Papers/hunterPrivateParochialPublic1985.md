## My notes

* [[Social control theory]]
	* Standards and values for assessing appropriate and deviant behavior.
	* The structural component includes the patterned distribution of resources within a social group to sanction members.
* Three different social orders: **the private**, **the parochial**, and **the public**.
	* These different social orders can be arrayed along a continuum of decreasing affect or sentiment from private to the public. E.g., friend, neighbor, fellow citizen.
	* All these ties and interactions are embedded in a [[network]] making them more or less possible.
	* Each also has their own distribution of [[rights]] and [[responsibilities]] to each other with different proportions in each [[social order]].
	* Each of these social orders also have different institutional [[loci]] and different needs/wants fulfilled (homes vs. [[schools]]/[[stores]]/[[clubs]]/ vs. [[police]]).
		* Who holds the [[monopoly]] on [[power]]/force and the ability to enforce the rules? What happens when individuals feel as if the state is failing them in their duty to dispense [[justice]]?
		* Disjunction between fears of [[crime]] and actual crime rates. People are afraid of transgressions against the common order.
		* Function of the police is to maintain order not to catch criminals. They are fundamentally reactive.
		* There is a limitation of the [[public sphere]] to maintain order particularly through the police.
		* **The solution**: "The solution to the dilemma is not for the state to engage in direct social control, that is, to attempt to increase its efficiency in catching criminals; but engage in social control activities in conjunction with the state and parochial order." #quote
	* There is a real-world, [[spatial]], physical component to all of these social orders too.
	* <mark>I wonder how the author would respond to pieces which finds the thickness of ties does not always impede criminality.</mark> #highlight
