## My notes

### Chapter 1 - Social Problems and the Sociology of Deviance

* “Social problems are… simply… perplexing questions about human societies proposed for solution.” -> Concern with social problems is very distinctly a concern of the USA -> see Progressive Era -> prison reform, settlement houses, temperance, housing, eliminating poverty, improving employment conditions -> beginnings of a social science, very concerned with legislative reform. #quote 
  
* However another strand in early Sociology ([[Auguste Comte]] and [[Herbert Spencer]]) is the scientific study of human society not so focused on problems (and in some cases openly hostile to it). At least in the USA, the social problems approach kind of won out.
  
* By the 20th century, Sociology’s reform efforts weren’t going so well, and the field felt the need to validate itself as a valid, independent scientific discipline -> methodology, research design, theory -> [[Weber]], [[Durkheim]] -> social neutrality -> cause quite a divide between those who wanted to study social problems and those who didn’t.
  
* Pendulum that’s constantly swinging back and forth (also always the issue of value imposition when social scientists try to solve problems) -> “... situations or behavior considered to be problems, on finer analysis may prove to be expressions of cherished values or institutionalized norms crucial to the operation of society… solutions to social problems may be impossible.” #quote 

Definition as an issue -> How do we even define what’s a social problem?

1. Social problems are situations impressing a large number of competent observers as needing remedy by collective action ([[Clarence Case]]) -> conflates sociological opinion with public opinion and an implied faith in democracy. Who are the “competent observers”? As we saw with the [[Progressive Era]], danger in relying too much upon so-called experts as well.
    
2. Social pathology -> We’re trying to build up a science with some objective evidence base to build upon. Attempt to build up a biological/medical model of society. Diagnose the ills and cure them. Always more oriented toward the individual rather than the society.
    
3. Rise of cultural relativism by working with Anthropology and broader societal trends questioning American values. [[Social disorganization]] -> problems come from a lack of integration and uneven cultural development. However problems -> doesn’t distinguish between social and personal disorganization -> ethnographies find slums can be quite organized -> also very quickly reduces to value choices of the author concerning whether or not a slum is actually disorganized or not.
    
4. Social dysfunctions -> The organization of social life requires the creation of institutional structures to meet the needs of the people and contribute to the integration of individuals within larger society. Anything which inhibits individuals from meeting their needs or from being integrated can be considered social dysfunction -> hard to determine what’s functional and dysfunctional (changes so much from time period to time period). Cannot escape value judgments.
    
5. Social problems as deviance. [[Merton]] and [[anomie|Anomie]]. Not perfect. Lots of complexity in the data. Ends and means distinction isn’t easy to maintain.
    
6. New deviance sociology -> Not so concerned with structural sources of deviance. More concerned with symbolic interaction and social control (His 1951 book, Social Pathology) -> focus on the consequences of the moral order and social control -> how categories of deviance are invoked and applied to groups/individuals “stereotyping” -> gives meaning and form to deviance, and then stabilizing it as secondary deviation.

	1. [[labeling theory|Labeling theory]]. Has been vulgarized a bit. Advocacy groups have taken it up to support criminals. “... most serious charge is that labeling theory depicts social control as arbitrary… makes deviance a kind of artifact or spurious imputation of social control.” -> Lemert claims this misses the point that s[[ymbolic interactionism]] is a dynamic, individualized process, kind of like a game/contest -> also misses the point that certain societal reactions are going to be more/less conducive to secondary deviation -> trying to define deviance definitionally overlooks the way society reacts to objective differences in behavior overtime. #quote 
	   
	2. Doesn’t mean everything is relative. There’s a reason why most societies disapprove of incest, adultery, cruelty to children, murder, rape, theft, etc -> human interaction always occurs within biological, psychological, ecological, technological, and organizational limits.
	   
	3. Back to social problems -> “... discloses a strong fixed critical stance towards the ideology, values, and methods of state-dominated agencies of social control.” -> however we need to make it more scientific and understand the costs and benefits of exerting control over certain deviant actions vs. others (or not at all) , how damaging are these supposed deviations -> a step forward in being a value-less, objective scientific endeavour. #quote 

### Chapter 2 - Social Structure, Social Control, and Deviation

We still need to refine our language and discussion around deviance.

#### Structural Version of Deviation: Criticism of Merton and anomie

- Merton and anomie -> some difficulties in separating out culture and social forces (what is culture in a scientific sense which we can grapple with, measure, and treat empirically) -> Lemert sidesteps culture and says only human beings define, regulate, and control the behavior of other humans (otherwise you animate culture to the status of an independent actor which feels and acts) and groups of humans -> run into issues trying to explain why some conform and others don’t.
    
- No clear distinction between means and ends (some values are ends and other times means) -> money is the end but sometimes money is a means (focusing too much on the means or the ends).
    
- Dig in further, “... values are factors that within physical and biological limits affect choice.” -> difference between the act of valuation vs. the observable pattern of behavior demonstrating the position of a value -> values guide our actions and help us assess the costs -> order of value satisfaction in groups must be understood as the product of the interaction of many individuals, using the group and others with different value hierarchies to achieve what the individual wants, “... pattern of his choices in a group setting may not correspond to his subjective hierarchy…” #quote
    
- Values can be learned symbolically and are carried out reflectively.
	- Some deviation can be explained this way as when a dominant group imposes its will on more marginalized groups. They’re carrying out values learned symbolically and were once considered conforming behavior.

- Values can be more calculated and instrumental, designed to achieve some ends while minimizing costs (sacrificing other “values” as it were).
	- Can be learned as it were and made on the surface to seem as if the values in question are held. But internally (symbolically?) individuals may not hold these values and are simply following them to achieve their ends.
    
- Another criticism is that the pressure generated on individuals comes from different value systems of which the individual is a part of, not really from the inability to achieve cultural success-goals. The individual is “captured” by the claims of various groups they’re a part of. Over behavior is then an ordering of different values held by the various groups the individual is a part of -> think of traffic violations basically -> “practical morality”
    
- Some crime is a result of risks not paying off (contractors paying employees from funds which are expected to come but don’t appear can be subject to insufficient funds felony offenses, unmarried mother).
    
- Is it really true crime is more common amongst the lower classes? -> Doesn’t seem likely.
    
- Strange that Merton never mentions group or collective adaptations -> “... need for a theory of associational groups as agencies which fix and alter the order of value satisfaction as well as shape means to ends…” -> white collar crime is as much a crime of an organization as it is of individuals -> technological factors can play a role in deviance or not (overloading trucks done by corporations, not by the Navy, different priorities but also differential ability to know they were overloading their trucks). #quote 
    
- Merton doesn’t deal with primary and secondary deviation (how it originates) and (how deviant acts are symbolically attached to persons and the consequences of such attachment for subsequent deviation).

#### Revisionist Critique of Merton

- Social control must be taken as an independent variable and as a causal factor in acts of deviance. Taken above with the other critiques, we can assume when social control is high, individuals who deviate are probably deviating due to internally held and hard to break patterned behavior. When social control is low, it’s harder to say individuals are deviating due to strongly held norms vs. simply doing a calculus of benefits.
    
- Sometimes an action cannot be determined as deviant or not solely from observing the external, objective action. The context in which it’s happening must be known (see a cocktail party where everyone gets progressively drunker) -> process of normalization where certain values are sacrificed to preserve others, ease the confusion, different settings and groups will have completely different views of normal -> anomie then develops in a state of confusion where social actors cannot discover acceptable meanings for the departure from the rules which are mutually acceptable.
    
- Active social control is a continuous process in which values are consciously examined, decisions made as to those values which should be dominant, and collective action taken to that end -> points to our interest in innovation (constantly undercutting or creating new values and modifying the order of their satisfaction by changing the costs) -> pointing to the constantly changing and contingent nature of what is and isn’t deviant (government regulation -> constantly trying to shift what’s normal and what’s deviant -> antitrust regulation in particular) -> law mostly concerned with the ends (regulating the behavior rather than necessarily increasing arrests of it or something like that), policeman focused on maximum protection rather than maximum enforcement of the law, juvenile justice system frequently confused as to what its end should be.
    
- Sociology is the study of the processes by which a variety of behaviors in differing contexts are given deviant or not meaning.

### Chapter 3 - Secondary Deviation

* Some primary deviation is dealt with without causing secondary deviation -> deviant behavior within the acceptable amounts of deviation, a problem of everyday life which can be managed.
  
* Secondary deviation is a problem of morality and stigmatization. Causes the person to reorganize themselves around the facts of deviance and recreate their conception of self to include deviancy. Some people have engaged in a large variety of normalization/rationalization of past wrongs.
  
* “Secondary deviation concerns processes which create, maintain, or intensify stigma…” -> deviance is accepted as a solution to problems of the person standing in a stigmatized position -> “... awareness of unenviable features of the self is a complex rather than a simple reciprocal of societal insults to identity… efforts at validating the self are complicated…” #quote
  
* Societies tend to sustain deviance, necessary for promoting group solidarity, differentiating the good from the bad.
  
* **Stigmatization** -> “... a process of attaching visible signs of moral inferiority to persons…” -> for stigmatization to establish a deviant identity it must be disseminated throughout society -> prevent reintegration of criminals into society -> “... a system of deterrent punishments not only fails to repress crime but also preserves a criminal class.” #quote
  
* Some debate over whether consistent or inconsistent (thus seen as arbitrary and unfair) application of punishment is more important for inculcating a deviant identity in people:
	1. Inconsistency between the stigma and the punishment.
	2. Inconsistent application of stigma/penalties to the person at different times/places.
	3. Inconsistent penalties or stigma applied to persons in the same jurisdiction/by the same law officials.
	   
* Stigmatization is a collective process which necessarily misrepresents a person and thus Lemert deduces it naturally arouses feelings of injustice and what not.
  
* Social control enforces stigmatization (parole, restrictive rules in prison), particularly parole where people get penalized for behavior that would otherwise be considered normal -> mental institutions, “... the means of institutional control were those by which madness was made permanent.” -> mental hospitals make it more difficult to normalize expressive behavior and secondary deviance can spawn -> Feelings of hostility and deep frustration -> no bonds of trust or attachment being built, no normalizing being done, no integration happening of any sorts. #quote 

#### The Role of Subculture in propagating secondary deviance 

* Does recidivism happen because of a continuing sense of injustice reinforced by stigmatization and strained relationships with the outside world OR is due to an acquired ideological view of the world where this new evidence confirms his preexisting, gained in prison suspicions? And then how does this all fit into the fact that different sorts of deviations are best conducted solo or in groups?

  

#### Positive side of negative identities

* Offer temporary or relatively stable solutions to life problems if they represent a perceived lower order of human existence, it provides new means to ends sought. This means degradation has its limits -> “Organization of social control of deviance at most has a marginal influence on the interactional process which gives it existential meaning. Collective efforts to organize rewards and punishments, to repress deviance and promote reformation along expected lines are always subject to vicissitudes of interpretation... “ #quote
  
* Negative identities can also have economic benefits -> repressive laws created a “drug problem” in the USA -> BUT “... remains to be shown that laws themselves cause addiction. More plausible are the assertions that laws and policy determine access to drugs, their forms of use, the attributes of the addict population…” etc. -> need to understand the process of deviancy -> claims people drift into deviance by specific actions rather than informed choices -> what problems are solved, what remain, how society reacts -> drift continues, as previous actions delimit future possibilities (even if the person doesn’t quite realize) -> Great deal of chance involved (contingency) -> takes time for realization to set in. #quote 
  
* People eventually realize criminal life isn’t as bad as people stigmatize it to be. Humans are remarkably adaptable to certain situations. Depends upon: 1) how clearly their role is defined 2) Possession of knowledge to enact that role 3) Motivation to play their role -> gets back to the idea of how well can you accept your role (will change your whole value hierarchy).

“... persons become secondary deviants because they manage to find more satisfactory solutions to their problems through deviance than through non-deviance…” -> Updated rational hedonism look -> some secondary deviation is more neurotic and self-destructive though (presents great challenges for [[differential association]], some addicts attempts to quit are actually triggers for continued addiction, “So long as he keeps trying to be what he knows he isn’t, his problems continue. Only by equating the self with the stuttering symptoms can change be brought about.” -> rewarding and punishing -> sometimes we internalize the deviant role so much we can no longer fulfill it and satisfy ourselves even as we continue to try to knowing it will hurt us. #quote

Think of these deviants as yourself when you have been living in a foreign land for sometime and you have cravings for things which are familiar. When drug addicts go straight, it’s a similar feeling. An identity problem, “Who am I? What’s my role?”

The underlying issue is one of rights of the individual vs. the necessities which come about from collective life -> scientific tyranny of social control where someone is punished based not on their threat to society by someone’s authoritative judgment that they’re threatening.
